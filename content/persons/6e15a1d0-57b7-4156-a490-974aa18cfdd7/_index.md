<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Zoe’s earliest memories paint a vivid picture of curiosity and tenacity from a young age. At merely three, coastal hikes and foggy mornings in California captivated her adventurous essence. Her childhood was rich with exploration—sand dunes, evening star-gazing, and towering tree climbs filled her days. By age six, her budding interest in technology was evident when she built a simple circuit with her dad. As years passed, she delved deeper into tech, creating a website at eleven and tackling urban explorations by fifteen. Alongside her trusted friends, Zoe explored the burgeoning discovery of her magical abilities, accidentally levitating objects and influencing outcomes in high school. Leaving California at seventeen to pursue college at Columbia marked a significant life shift, filled with mixed emotions but vibrant hopes for her future.</div><br>
