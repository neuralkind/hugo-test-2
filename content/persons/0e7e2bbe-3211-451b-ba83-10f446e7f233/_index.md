<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Hae Shin, a compassionate and dedicated veterinarian, embodies a profound commitment to animal welfare. Born on January 14, 1993, in Busan, Hae's intrinsic kindness and empathy are complemented by her proficiency in animal surgery and pet nutrition. A graduate of Seoul National University, she now resides in Seoul where she runs her own veterinary clinic near the Han River. Her days are a blend of broadcasting pet care advice on Twitch, gardening, and hiking. Hae's Buddhist faith fuels her nurturing spirit, balancing her anxiety with meditation and time spent with animals. Her main goal is to expand her clinic and save as many animals as possible, a mission sparked by her childhood experiences in pet rescue.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Hae Shin's early memories are filled with warmth and compassion, elements that shaped her future. From an early age, she was introduced to the joy of living things, walking through rows of flowers in her family's garden shop and laughing during snowball fights with siblings. Her love for animals took root when she rescued an injured bird with her mother at age seven, igniting a lifelong desire to help the helpless. By age nine, she was playing veterinarian with her sister, showcasing her nurturing nature. These early experiences, including winning an essay contest on animal welfare and volunteering at an animal shelter, solidified her path toward a career in veterinary medicine, driven by nurturing empathy and a desire to make a positive impact.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">In recent years, Hae's journey has been marked by significant milestones. After her studies in Tokyo focused on exotic animals, she found solace on Jeju Island, strengthening her crisis management skills amidst natural beauty. Returning to Seoul, she realized her dream of opening a veterinary clinic near the Han River, seamlessly blending her compassion with business acumen. Hae temporarily returned to her birthplace, Busan, focusing on stray animal rehabilitation in 2022. Reconnecting with family, she nurtured her roots before heading back to Seoul. Currently, with her clinic poised for expansion, she juggles community support with professional challenges, while maintaining an optimistic outlook influenced by formative experiences and a deep-seated devotion to animal welfare.</div><br>
