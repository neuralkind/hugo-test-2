<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Hana Kim is a 22-year-old emerging artist with a background rich in creativity and complexity. Raised in Seoul, she is deeply influenced by her artistic surroundings and her nurturing mother. A student of Fine Arts, Hana is a visionary whose creativity extends beyond the canvas through her remarkable ability to create lifelike illusions. Her personality radiates openness and agreeability, yet she harbors insecurities rooted in her unique dual life. As an empathic and introspective individual, she copes with life's challenges through art and meditation. Despite her quiet nature, Hana aspires to open her art studio while mastering illusion magicâ€”goals that align with her desire to find harmony and purpose in a world that often demands one to conform.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Hana's early memories are a tapestry of artistic exploration and familial connections. Childhood moments span from the comforting embrace of her mother to her initial forays into art with crayons. Highlights include receiving praise in art class and the thrill of her first piano recital. Her childhood was interspersed with defining experiences, such as being captivated by books and galleries with her brother and the life-altering discovery of her magical abilities. The move to a city at age 10 marked a period of apprehension and excitement. This transitional period was pivotal, as Hana embraced her dual identity and enrolled in Crescent Institute, a decision shaped by both fear and the drive to harness her gifts.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">Recently, Hana's journey as an artist has taken her across continents, experiencing diverse cultures and catalyzing her growth. Beginning with a prestigious internship in Seoul, she immersed herself in her roots before exploring the artistic tapestry of Kyoto. The exposure to Japan's rich cultural heritage reignited her creative vision, leading her to Paris, where the city's vibrancy further transformed her artistry. Throughout these travels, Hana engaged deeply with traditional and modern art forms. Seeking solace amid this whirlwind, she retreated to Bali, drawing strength from its natural beauty. These experiences have not only enriched her canvas but also fortified her resolve to live authentically, blending her artistic and magical aspirations.</div><br>
