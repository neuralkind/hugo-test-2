<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Ga-young Im is a 26-year-old imaginative and witty freelance webtoon artist based in Seoul. Known for her exceptional drawing skills and strong storytelling abilities, Ga-young is characterized by her introverted and sarcastic nature, often seen sketching in coffee shops or lost in the worlds of anime. Her personality is marked by high openness and conscientiousness, balancing an ambitious vision of crafting a breakout webtoon series with a backdrop of anxiety and a fear of failure. Encouraged by her grandmother, a former art teacher in Busan, Ga-young embraced the creative path early, leaving a corporate design career to chase freedom in artistry. She remains grounded by meditation and lo-fi music, thriving in both solitude and vibrant creative communities.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Ga-young's early memories are adorned with vivid moments spent in her grandmother’s art studio in Busan, fostering her love for art. By age two, Ga-young found joy in smeared paints on the kitchen table, laying the foundation for her artistic journey. Memorable summers were spent sketching superheroes with her brother by the seaside, and she won her first art award by age six, with her grandmother praising her talents. By age seven, digital art became a new frontier, pushing her storytelling creativity. Ga-young's adolescent years were steeped in anime love, expanding her artistic perspectives, and included her first successful webtoon at age 21. With inspirations rooted deeply in early awards and influences, Ga-young's artistic path was carved by family encouragement and summer sketching adventures.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">Continuing her artistic odyssey, Ga-young began her freelance venture in Busan in early 2018, tapping into nostalgic flavors of her upbringing and drawing inspiration from the local cafes. From mid-2020, Tokyo's rich manga culture became her creative beacon, enriching her art style through vibrant cultural interactions. Living amidst Seoul's energetic ambience from 2022, Ga-young advanced her skill set with an eye on an international webtoon competition. The metro's hustle heightened her anxiety but also polished her artistic flair. In June 2023, seeking creative rejuvenation, she retreated to Jeju Island's peacefulness, gaining introspection and breakthroughs by the shore. This balance of immersion and renewal underlines Ga-young’s continual evolution as an artist, breathing new life into her imaginative pursuits. </div><br>
