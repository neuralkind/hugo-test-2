At age 4, a sunlit day building sandcastles with family left impressionable memories. By age 6, gifted toy tools fuelled his knack for handiwork, dovetailed further in his uncle's workshop by age 9. The kaleidoscope of colors witnessed at the Busan cultural parade left a lasting imprint, igniting a zest for vibrancy at age 12. His formative years were dotted with heartfelt moments, profound conversations, and recognition of his technical skills, such as during the school science fair. These early encounters paved his path toward technical pursuits and a passion for carpentry, tying his early exploration to lifelong interests.", 'persona': "JiYong Choi, a 39-year-old from Busan, resides in Seoul, embracing a life rich in technical prowess.
