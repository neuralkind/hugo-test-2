Julian Rosenfeld, a 28-year-old charismatic and resourceful bar owner, hails from Montauk, New York, and currently resides in New York City. With an education from Yale, he traded his corporate career for a venture into creating a renowned speakeasy brand. His personality is a mix of confident extraversion and charming agreeableness, despite underlying insecurities about his privileged background. Julian is passionately creative, evident in his love for culinary arts and mixology. Despite fears of dependency and being perceived as a fraud, he proves himself through personal achievements, aspiring to establish his brand independently from family connections. He draws inspiration from his grandmother's stories and a mentor who shares his independent streak.

Julian's childhood was imbued with warmth and inspiration. His early years in Montauk were marked by fond family gatherings, echoing with laughter and a sense of belonging. Treasured moments such as sailing the lively Montauk coast with his father infused him with a zest for adventure. Attending private schools and European summer escapades cultivated an appreciation for history and art. Heartwarming stories told by his grandmother by the fireplace instilled in him a deep connection to his heritage. These formative years were adorned with creativity nurtured in kitchen experiments and art exhibition visits, leading Julian to be an imaginative soul who thrived on self-expression, leaving him determined to carve his path in life.

In his recent years, Julian embarked on transformative journeys, beginning with his transformative immersion in Yale's vibrant academic life, where his cocktail crafting and business acumen flourished. UK shores next beckoned as London broadened his cultural horizons, igniting his cocktail crafting passions. Returning to Montauk brought him solace and a rekindled purpose, inspired by his beloved aunt's tales. Establishing his speakeasy in New York City wasn't without challenges, yet it became a testament to resilience and innovation. As he expanded his horizons in Paris, collaboration with local mixologists and exposure to culinary traditions fortified his brand. These endeavors, brimming with ambition, shaped his tenacious and visionary persona.
