<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Aya Kuroda, a 17-year-old tech prodigy from Tokyo, is an emotional virtuoso in virtual reality environments. Calm but curious, her interests lie in VR design, psychological thrillers, and strategy games. Aya is known for her empathy, keen observation, and meticulous nature, though she's also analytical and reserved. Her work at Station-11 focuses on mastering emotional influences within simulated spaces, earning her the nickname 'The Emotion Weaver.' Despite being an only child raised by a single mother, Aya developed a strong fascination with technology early on. While skeptical of authority, she maintains a circle of fellow VR enthusiasts who both admire and cautiously appreciate her unique skills and influence in VR environments.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Aya's early memories vividly encapsulate her fascination with technology. From lying in a crib surrounded by toys to constructing a cardboard spaceship, these experiences fueled her creativity. By three, she was already mimicking her mother's work on a toy computer, signaling an early curiosity in tech. At age four, a visit to the Tokyo Tech Museum ignited her passion, and by eight, a visit to a VR arcade solidified her love for virtual realms. Gifted a VR kit at nine, she delved into virtual experimentation, crafting her first VR garden at ten. This unique blend of imagination and early tech exploration shaped her passion for VR design and emotional manipulation.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">Embarking on widespread journeys, Aya refined her skills in diverse settings. At Station-11 in Tokyo, she honed her emotional influence techniques. San Francisco introduced her to the cultural vibrance she aimed to mimic in VR, while Berlin ignited her interest in AI integration within these environments. In Seoul, Aya engaged in tech ethics, emphasizing the moral pulse of her projects. A stint in London allowed her to juxtapose art with her VR ventures, leading to an exploration of reality versus imagination. Hong Kong's urban dynamics inspired new dimensions in her virtual realities, culminating in Toronto at an emotional VR symposium, where she explored the intricate balance of control and chaos.</div><br>
