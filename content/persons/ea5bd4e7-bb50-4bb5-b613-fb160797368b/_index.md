<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Selene White, a young woman of 23, is wrapped in enigma, as she navigates life with a fusion of intellect, introspection, and melancholy. Her hobbies include reading old mystery novels and sketching scenes from her dreams. A remarkably open-minded individual, Selene possesses a unique ability to manipulate memories, albeit with the risk of erasing parts of herself. Driven by the need to regain her lost memories and understand the disappearance of her parents, she channels her expertise in psychology and cognitive science at the Crescent Institute. Though guarded and melancholic, her profound empathy and intelligence make her a compelling figure as she seeks truth and mastery over her powers. </div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Selene's early memories form a vivid collage of simple yet pivotal moments. At age two, she first recalls fixating on sunbeams streaming through the living room. Her mother was a comforting presence during playful moments with colorful blocks on the terrace at age three. By age five, a shadowy park figure became an ephemeral friend. These early experiences laid the foundation for her artistic sensibility, winning a sketching contest years later and finding solace in books like "The Lost Woods." A poignant childhood discovery of her parents' secret introduced emotions of fear and urgency, ultimately leading to the revelation of her magical powers at 17, forever tangling identity and destiny.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">In recent years, Selene has embarked on a journey of both scientific inquiry and personal enlightenment. Her immersion into graduate studies at Boston's Miskatonic University allowed her to delve deeper into cognitive science's intricacies. A subsequent collaboration in MÃ¼nster, Germany, balanced the charm of its medieval surroundings with scientific rigor, refining her persuasive talents. Finding a home at the Crescent Institute, she navigated unfolding mysteries and magical exploration. Unplanned travel to Kyoto enriched her cultural comprehension, reviving her childhood sunbeam memories. Her field studies in New York City became a vital chapter in piecing together her lost narrative, steering her towards self-understanding as her October journey unfolds.</div><br>
