<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Nozomi Saito, a Japanese national born in Tokyo, is a creative and empathetic individual with a talent for crafting virtual worlds. Equipped with a deep understanding of emotions, she aims to excel at Station-11 and unravel the mysteries of The Horizon through emotional AI environments. Her positive traits include her ability to remain calm and empathetic, though she sometimes experiences self-doubt and sensitivity. Inspired by her parents, both AI researchers, Nozomi has developed a strong foundation in emotional intelligence and programming. With an eye for creative design, her journey is marked by her goal-oriented nature and a profound connection to emotions, both her own and others'.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Nozomi's early memories are filled with impactful events that shaped her love for virtual worlds and creativity. Fascinated by the beauty of falling snowflakes in Tokyo, her imagination blossomed when building simple virtual toys with her father at the age of three, instilling pride and excitement. Winning her first class art contest at age seven marked the beginning of her artistic journey, celebrated by the applause of her classmates. Her first VR experience at age six was awe-inspiring, sparking her love for the fusion of imagination and reality. Engaging in drawing and creating VR projects with her parents nurtured a sense of connection and accomplishment. Overcoming her fear to join a VR competition at age eleven fortified her determination, and her acceptance into Station-11 solidified her resolve to excel in emotionally responsive environments.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">In her recent years, Nozomi's journey has taken her across countries to explore, learn, and grow. After her graduation from Station-11, she interned in Kyoto, honing her skills and finding peace in its landscapes. Her passion led her to San Francisco, where she contributed to emotional AI research, blending art and science. A cultural sabbatical in Seoul revitalized her creativity, inspiring her work upon her return to Tokyo. There, she embarked on personal projects and finally ventured to Australia, joining a VR think tank to innovate virtual environments. A series of workshops in Toronto provided both teaching and learning experiences. Returning to Kyoto as faculty, she now combines her expertise with heartfelt storytelling, nurturing future VR creators while finding contentment and grounding in familiar surroundings.</div><br>
