<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Kira's childhood memories are rich with exploration and connection to nature. At just one, she found peace under a towering oak in her backyard, enchanted by the sunlight filtering through leaves above. By age three, she was captivated by the colorful leaves during her first painting session, and by four, she bonded with her mother over the simple joy of planting flowers. By age six, climbing trees offered solace and freedom, while her grandmother's stories about plant healing ignited a budding fascination. By nine, her first encounter with magic as she witnessed the revival of a dying sapling marked both awe and an emerging sense of responsibility. Throughout her childhood, Kira's love for nature grew, from attending botanical classes to planting a willow tree in her grandmother's honor. Her teen years solidified her connection to nature, particularly when she saved a dying oak using her abilities, instilling pride and purpose within her.</div><br>
