JiYong Choi invited Jesse Campbell
The vibrant street of Itaewon brims with the tantalizing aroma of exotic spices and the hum of lively chatter as JiYong Choi and Jesse Campbell embark on their Cultural Cuisine Exploration. Today, their goal is to traverse culinary horizons with friend Chloé Martin, placing each dish in the context of its cultural tapestry. With plates resembling canvases, delicacies from Africa to South America tell stories rich with tradition and taste.

JiYong, his technical flair momentarily set aside, immerses himself in pensive conversation with a Moroccan chef, learning the meticulous craft behind perfect tagine. His eyes, however, hint at seeking inspiration for future carpentry designs from the intricate patterns carved on the serving dishes. Jesse, brimming with enthusiasm, finds solace in the expression of culinary art, nodding with enlightened appreciation as he relates flavors to artistic expressions back in Seoul's art spaces.

Chloé, ever the cultural enthusiast, leads the group through the street market with a whimsical narrative unfolding as they sample each food. Her observations about each cultural nuance spark lively dialogue and laughter among the trio, serving as a metaphorical spice blending their diverse backgrounds into a harmonious dish.

Together, the trio shares stories, explores flavors ranging from savory Korean pancakes to fiery Indian curries, and laces each bite with whispered appreciation for diverse global traditions. Like an ensemble of artists, they create a vibrant, flavorful tapestry of experience, an ode to unity in diversity through the universal language of food.

Jesse Campbell embarks on a morning photography walk through Bukchon Hanok Village, capturing Seoul's traditional architectural charm and stories encoded within its historic streets.
In the heart of Seoul's bustling tapestry, Jesse Campbell steps into the serene world of Bukchon Hanok Village, camera in hand and anticipation in his soul. Bathing in the soft golden light of early morning, the village's narrow alleyways unfold, adorned with century-old hanok houses that stand as whispered tales of Korea’s architectural heritage. The traditional rooftops curl gracefully against the dawn sky, each tile echoing with the whispers of history. 

Jesse, with his photographer's eye, captures the interplay between heritage and the modern city skyline—a delicate dance of shadows and light. His lens drifts gently over intricately carved wooden doors and flowing hanji windows, where the past breathes in every crevasse. He pauses frequently, savoring the quietude before the city's daily rush envelops the village, listening attentively to the rustle of hanbok-clad locals offering morning greetings.

As he meanders further into the village’s heart, a delightful silence surrounds him. The world feels paused, art and architecture becoming a single, harmonious entity. He's reminded of his childhood's awe for stories etched in wood and his affinity toward capturing moments that unite people with their past. Each click of his camera resonates with a promise—a pledge to preserve these narratives that silently reside within Bukchon's soul. Two hours slip away, each moment savored like a chapter in an unfolding journey, leaving Jesse enriched by a sense of timelessness.

Jesse enjoys a solo poetry retreat at Namsan Library, delving into creativity amidst books and autumn ambiance.
The Namsan Library stood amidst shades of warm yellows and deep reds, leaves swirling gently in the autumnal breeze, as Jesse entered its quiet embrace. Today, the library transformed into a sanctuary for introspection, where creative echoes and whispers of literary souls past lingered invisibly in the air. Jesse found a secluded nook, cocooned by towering shelves, each filled with tales that subconsciously infused ideas into his waiting mind.

As Jesse sat down, the sturdy oak table became a canvas for imagination. With a steaming cup of Earl Grey beside him, he began crafting verses, guided by the symphony outside the window—rustling leaves, distant chimes from a nearby temple, and a gentle hum of the city. He allowed the flow of words to reflect the calm yet complex rhythm within, drawing from a well of emotions steeped in memory and newfound experiences gleamed from recent art journeys.

During moments of pause, Jesse looked up, soaking in inspiration from the books around him, the silhouettes of trees dancing in the afternoon light, and the steady ebb and flow of library visitors. The quiet solitude was not lonely; instead, it brimmed with potential for artistic reverie. Each sentence carried a whisper of past adventures, quietly melding with hopes and dreams that breathed life into each written line.

Two hours slipped gracefully, punctuated by the soft echo of pen on paper and Jesse's occasional smiles at passing thoughts. By the end of his retreat, Jesse emerged with a handcrafted tapestry of poems—glimpses of future workshops and personal reflections, harmonizing beautifully with the changing season outside the library.
