Yuna Park explores new artistic outlets at a Seoul painting workshop, channeling past inspirations into vibrant, dynamic artwork.


The crisp Seoul morning is illuminated with watercolor skies as Yuna Park steps into the Seoul Art Collective Studio. Today, she's painting with more than just brushes—her emotions and experiences coalesce as her palette. The studio, resonant with creativity and dotted with vibrant canvases, exudes an inviting aura that embraces her.

Yuna's attire reflects her eclectic spirit—splattered jeans and a loose-fitting tee echo her vibrant personality. As she picks up a brush, the canvas becomes an extension of her inner dance, inspired by her recent contemplative moments at Haneul Park and the soulful echoes of the Seoul Jazz Museum. Each stroke is a ballet—fluid, intentional, and captivated by rhythm.

The studio, hushed but for the gentle hum of ceiling fans and occasional clinks of paint tubes, creates a backdrop for introspection. Here, Yuna channels the vibrant energy from her K-pop choreographies into bold colors and daring patterns upon the blank canvas.

With layers upon layers, her painting emerges—a kaleidoscope of themes drawn from her past activities, each hue revealing an untold story or cherished memory. Rich ochres narrate moments of jazz-infused introspection, while twilight blues evoke serene Tai Chi mornings. Her hand brings to life iridescent bursts of color, reminiscent of her dance's frenetic intensity.

As the clock ticks, marking the finale of her two-hour painting journey, Yuna steps back, admiring a masterpiece that embodies both her vibrant past and aspirational future. It represents new creative outlets—an ode to her dynamic spirit and a testament to her unyielding dedication.

Yuna Park seeks tranquility at a silent meditation retreat in the Seoul Zen Garden, embracing introspection and inner peace.
Nestled within the serene embrace of the Seoul Zen Garden, Yuna Park embarks on a journey of introspection. Today's silent meditation retreat offers a gravitational pause from her usual vibrant whirl of creativity and motion. Under the shelter of whisper-thin maple leaves, the soft rustling harmonizes with her breathing, creating a rhythm that echoes her internal balance. 

Yuna settles on the soft forest floor, her gaze softened by a tranquil pond's light reflections. The familiar urge to choreograph is quiet within the zen whispers pacing back and forth in her mind. Instead, she lets her thoughts float like the pond lilies brushing against each other in their gentle dance. It's a balm that seeps into her soul, complementing the silence that encourages growth and subtle insights.

As afternoon sunlight pours over the garden, filtering through verdant canopies, Yuna feels a connection with the earth, a clarity that's rare amid her usual creative flurry. Her thoughts mingle like leaves in the breeze, breeding ideas for upcoming routines enriched with inner peace. Contrary to her lively K-pop routines, this meditative space nurtures a different movement—one of profound calm and lucidity. As the retreat untangles the day's complex web, she understands the magnetic pull of such moments in nurturing her resilience and creativity.
