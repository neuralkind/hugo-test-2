Andrew and Neha have a brainstorming session at a Seoul café, exchanging folklore ideas for Andrew's storytelling podcast series.
Andrew Allen invited JiYong Choi
Andrew sat at a round wooden table in a sunlit corner of the local café, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee weaving into the air around him. The soft jazz music playing in the background set the stage for the storytelling brainstorming session he had been eagerly anticipating. As he flipped through his well-worn notebook, filled with vibrant notes and sketches from past storytelling sessions, he felt a bubbling mixture of excitement and trepidation.

Neha, an old friend from his school days and a fellow storytelling enthusiast, soon joined him. Her presence was as vibrant as the tales they scribbled. They greeted each other warmly, laughter mingling with the sounds of the bustling café. After ordering their favorite beverages – a latte for Andrew and a chai latte for Neha – they delved into a lively exchange of ideas centered around folklore from their diverse cultural backgrounds.

Each story traversed a different trajectory, from tales of resilient spirits weathering life’s challenges to heartwarming myths of love and camaraderie overcoming barriers. Neha suggested infusing Korean folk elements into their narratives, spurring Andrew's imagination further, painting scenes with the rich texture of local legends he had encountered during his journey in Busan. In return, Andrew mused over a haunting yet hopeful tale his grandmother once told him, one stirring with the traditions from the bayous of Louisiana, warmly received by Neha.

They scribbled and sketched, the quiet hum of creativity igniting sparks of inspiration between sips of their drinks. As their session drew closer to the end, they made plans to incorporate these creations into Andrew's budding podcast series, excited by the potential to intertwine their imaginations, bridging cultural stories across global borders.

Their animated conversations and heartfelt laughter turned heads occasionally, patrons perhaps mistaking them for aspiring novelists mapping the plot of a soon-to-be bestseller. Nevertheless, to Andrew and Neha, today was an opportunity to knit new dimensions into tales that transcended time and space.

JiYong spends the morning in profound reflection and solitude, perfecting his carpentry skills in his home workshop. His efforts are inspired by the fusion of tradition and modern design.
As the sun flirted with the beginnings of dawn, casting shimmering patterns on the walls of JiYong's intimate workshop, he felt a sense of excitement fill the crisp morning air. The small, yet bustling quarters whispered tales of wood, solitary musings, and caffeinated mornings stretched thin. 

Today was a dedicated journey into the realm of refined craftsmanship, an exploration of wooden grains and creative expression. JiYong allowed himself to immerse in the symphony of solitude. The familiar scent of freshly cut wood mingled with faint notes of sandalwood incense, a scent that wistfully transported him back to Busan’s serene sands. 

With the rhythmic whirl of the lathe and the precise hum of the jigsaw, JiYong embarked upon creating something meaningful. His fingers traced the intricate patterns of the oak slabs, channeling his aspirations for designing a unique coffee table inspired by Busan's coastal elegance. Each tap of the mallet and sweep of the chisel perfectly echoed the internal harmony he cherished. 

JiYong's movements were more than just practiced; they were poetic, weaving past memories with this tangible present. He danced through technique and tradition, crafting art from memory, producing surfaces with seamless finishes, ensuring no edge remained unchecked. Through the gentle embrace of his tools— each swish, scrape, and polish—, he forged a connection both profound and spiritual, subtly bridging the world of creation and reflection. 

As the clock ticked towards the later hours of the morning, and natural light painted the workshop’s floor with golden strokes, JiYong took a deep breath. Satisfied with the metamorphosis of raw material to refined creation, he relished in his evolved craftsmanship, all while dreaming of the day when patrons would admire his creations at a quaint beachside café.

JiYong Choi and Andrew Allen brainstormed a beachside café design, blending storytelling and cultural themes into the concept. They shared creative ideas over coffee in a cozy Seoul café, weaving their visions into a unified blueprint.
Rain was dancing on the café's windows in gentle cascades, imbuing the cozy Seoul café with an intimate warmth against the chill of early autumn. Seated at a corner table, dusty sketches, mood boards, and notebooks lay spread across the polished surface between JiYong Choi and Andrew Allen. JiYong, his fingers entwined with the handle of a rich caramel latte, spoke passionately about his vision for a welcoming beachside retreat — a café where stories thread like sea breezes through every conversation. Across from him, Andrew listened intently, his eyes alight with anticipation as he sketched potential layouts — reading nooks here and a storytelling corner there.

The dialogue ebbed and flowed like tides as they swapped visions, folding Andrew’s rich storytelling heritage into design touches, like mural ideas featuring tales from New Orleans. Over shared slices of carrot cake, Andrew proposed immersive live storytelling sessions, entangled with JiYong's dream to blend cultural vibrancies into the menu — zesty coastal snacks paired with warm, aromatic teas. Between sips of coffee and laughter, Andrew envisioned a 'Stories Bench’ by the windows, where visitors could scribe snippets of their own narratives for others to read. Through metaphoric and literal sketches, their ideas began to form contours, breathing life into the blueprint of JiYong's longstanding dream — a harmonious space echoing with laughter, aroma, music, and cultural tales.
