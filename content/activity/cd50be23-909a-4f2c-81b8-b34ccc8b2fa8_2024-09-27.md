Amy Ly spends a reflective Digital Detox Day at The Cloisters, absorbing inspiration from Medieval art and serene gardens.
The morning sun filtered through the lush canopy, casting intricate shadows on the cobblestones of The Cloisters, a tranquil retreat nestled within the urban sprawl of Manhattan. Today, Amy Ly had set out to find inspiration amidst the ancient echoes of sprawling Medieval art and the serene gardens that adorned this historic site.

Donning her favorite oversized scarf and a comfortable ensemble, Amy wandered through the tapestries and stone archways, her senses indulging in the calm, unhurried atmosphere. The distant hum of the city was a mere whisper here, replaced by the whispers of history etched into every corner.

In the garden, she found solace amidst the vibrant blooms, their colors reminiscent of the virtual landscapes she often crafted. Nearby, a serene fountain provided a soothing undertone as Amy settled on a weathered bench, sketchbook in hand. Here, amidst splashes of sunlight and the buzz of nature, she let the stillness fuel her creativity, each stroke of her pencil bringing a piece of this tranquil haven to life on paper.

Occasionally, she stood to admire the interplay of light and architecture, drawing parallels between these centuries-old constructions and her own digital creations. As midday approached, Amy felt rejuvenated, her mind brimming with fresh ideas inspired by the delicate balance of art and nature offered by The Cloisters.

In the park, Amy gathers a small crowd with an impromptu VR demonstration, evoking laughter and amazement as children and adults alike indulge in a glimpse of mesmerizing virtual landscapes.
