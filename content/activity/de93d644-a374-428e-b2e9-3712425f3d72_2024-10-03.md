Haelim Su explores contemporary installations at DDP Seoul, integrating fresh inspirations for her elderly art center vision.
Today, Haelim Su meanders through the sleek, angular corridors of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP), where the Modern Art Exhibition pulsates with fresh waves of creativity. Each installation blooms with innovative spirit and whispers stories of artistic triumph. 

Her journey is a vibrant tapestry of anticipation; the bold installations demand her senses to engage wholly—every corner presents a challenge to convention, a dialogue between past inspirations and future aspirations. Amidst the chorus of color and structure, Haelim finds herself drawn to a multimedia piece, where layers of video projections cascade vividly over textured canvases. It is a synesthetic dance of light and ink, urging contemplation on our digitally layered existence.

As she glides through the various art forms, each exhibiting different cultural narratives and avant-garde perspectives, she absorbs elements for her own projects—nodding, sketching inspirations on her ever-present notebook. Lost in her thoughts, she remembers her recent memories of Parisian boulevards and Tokyo's urban serenity, integrating snippets of these global insights into her upcoming venture, the elderly art center.

The DDP transforms into more than a public space—it is a crucible where Haelim contemplates her role as both an inventor and a caregiver, juxtaposing futuristic allure with the warmth of her pastoral roots. Haelim leaves the exhibition space, for the soft silhouettes of city structures lead her onto Gwangjang Market, drawn to its bustling life and aromatic sizzle, testing new ideas with each sensory encounter. Grounded and yet free, today's art journey fuels her dreams anew.

Haelim Su dives into the aromatic world of mulled wine creation at Hanok Village, blending spices and memories for a cozy solo evening.
The Hanok Village Cooking Studio resonated with the soft murmur of harmony as Haelim Su immersed herself in the art of crafting aromatic mulled wines. The dusk descended gracefully beyond the lattice windows, painting the room with a spectrum of twilight hues while ornate lanterns above twinkled like stars. Each warm breath lifted the inviting scents of cinnamon, clove, and citrus—the holy trinity of spices simmering gently in a copper pot before her.

The serene environment, reminiscent of a traditional Korean kitchen, was punctuated by the soothing crackle of firewood. Haelim, her apron clinging firmly to her waist, channeled her artistic flair into each stir and fold. A cut of fresh ginger and nutmeg promised an extra layer of warmth, their natural oils released into the wine—a deeply personal dance of taste and aroma as she remembered her winter holidays.

With careful precision, she sliced oranges, her mind wandering to her family get-togethers in Busan that celebrated community and comfort. Delicately placed into the pot, their zest brightened the night with whispered notes of childhood nostalgia. Every ingredient nurtured Haelim's senses, seamlessly blending past memories and present intentions.

Absent of companions, her solo culinary journey felt like a cherished meditation, each moment a step toward her grander vision of opening a community art hub. A soft smile crept onto Haelim's face as she ladled the warm liquid, capturing the essence of home and harmony in every glass—a reminder of her dreams waiting to unfurl.
