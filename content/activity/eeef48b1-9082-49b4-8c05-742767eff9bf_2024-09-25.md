James Wright spends a creative morning painting pottery at Color Me Mine, imparting vivid colors to an earthen mug.
On a brisk September morning, James Wright steps into the vibrant world of Color Me Mine, nestled on the charming streets of Upper West Side. Seeking solitude in creativity, he inhales the earthy scent of raw clay and paint as he wanders through rows of unpainted pottery, each one a blank canvas awaiting his touch. 

The pottery painting class is an intimate haven, alight with diffused sunlight streaming through large windows. The gentle hum of conversation and clink of brushes against ceramic usher in a sense of calm — a sanctuary from New York's relentless pace. James welcomes the familiar comfort of an apron over his attire, reminiscent of countless creative escapades in his life.

He takes a seat at a table scattered with vibrant palettes and brushes of various sizes, confronting the challenge of painting a large earthen mug. With a meditative focus, he dips his brush into a pool of deep ocean blue, mindful of each stroke, mixing colors until they mirror the city’s unpredictable sky.

The artist's ambiance stirs his memories, echoing those Sunday afternoons in Atlanta, where he would embrace familial creativity on similar ventures. Here, away from the structured logistics of his career, every measured brushstroke is a nod to spontaneity, filling the void with expressive swirls and splashes of color.

As hours pass, James glances at his watch, marveling at how time has slipped away. The mug now encapsulates a piece of his heart, with swirling motifs symbolizing movement — much like his journey in life. Content, he steps back to admire the day's creation, feeling a revitalized connection with himself.
