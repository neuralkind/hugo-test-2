Seohee embarks on a solo, artistic retreat at Han River Park, sketching serene landscapes to rejuvenate her creative spirit. A tranquil afternoon marked by nature-inspired creativity and reflection.
As the midday sun casts a gentle warmth over Seoul, Seohee parks her bicycle at Han River Park, her heart fluttering with anticipation for this long-awaited artistic escape. The air is crisp, tinged with the earthy scent of autumn leaves, and the river's flow whispers like an endless muse. Seohee finds a secluded spot overlooking the serene waters, unfurling her sketchbook with a ritualistic reverence.

With a deep breath, she allows the ambient sounds to become her soundtrack- the distant laughter of children playing, the rhythmic pedal of cyclists on the trail, and the soft hum of the city just beyond view. Each element transforms into a brushstroke as she captures the grace of swaying willow trees and the intricate dance of shadows cast by fluffy clouds.

Seohee's hands move fluidly, channeling both precision and intuition into each line and shade. Memories of her Aunt's studio echo in her mind as she expertly captures the textures and details of her surroundings, a testament to years nurtured amidst a palette of inspiration. Her sketches are more than recreations of the landscape; they are visual poems paying homage to her journey.

This retreat is not just about art; it's a vivid meditation, a gentle reawakening of her tangled layers of creativity after days entwined with routines at the dental clinic. As the sun dips toward the horizon, painting the sky in hues of coral and soft lavender, Seohee closes her sketchbook, feeling the calm embrace of fulfillment. She stands, taking one last lingering view of the rippling waters, grateful for this afternoon of soul-nourishing solitude.

Seohee and JiYong explore innovative clay techniques, melding creativity and camaraderie at the Incheon Ceramics Studio.
Seohee Ryu invited JiYong Choi
The sun began its slow descent over Incheon, casting gentle golden rays onto the red-tiled roof of the ceramics studio. Seohee, lightly humming, made her way across the cobblestone pathway, her favorite sketchpad and tools snugly nestled in her tote bag. Today promised an exploration into the realm of innovative clay techniques alongside her long-time friend, JiYong Choi.

Inside, the soothing scent of earth filled the modest workshop, echoing its rich artisanal legacy. JiYong greeted her with a warm smile, his hands already smeared with the rich texture of freshly kneaded clay. "Let's stir the creative pot today," he said, adjusting his apron, inadvertently leaving artistic specks on his cheek.

As the pottery wheel spun, Seohee's adept fingers guided the shapeless earth, conjuring a delicate vase, while JiYong, with his ever-attentive nature, prepared intricate wooden tools used for etching fine designs. Their banter flowed as smoothly as the clay itself, punctuated occasionally with bouts of laughter at either's squiggly creations or endearing mishaps.

JiYong introduced a method he'd recently devised: integrating slim bamboo strands into the clay, aiming for a skeletal framework that would burn away in the kiln. Seohee, enchanted by its potential, imagined floral engravings dancing upon its surface, and together, they experimented – building, reshaping, and watching art transform before their eyes.

The twinkle of ambient studio lighting seemed to glow a little bit brighter as their works slowly took form. By the time the clock signaled the workshop's end, Seohee and JiYong sat amidst myriad creations, simple yet extraordinary, each as unique as their shared friendship and every bit infused with the essence of their combined creativity.

Seohee Ryu immerses herself in a solo evening cello practice, adding harmonious layers to her creative tapestry at home.
As the golden twilight of Seoul envelops her cozy home, Seohee steps into her intimate sanctuary – a sunlit studio where time ebbs away with the mellifluous strains of a cello. Tonight, an evening of creative solitude reigns as she dedicates ninety serene minutes to mastering intricate melodies, adding a symphonic layer to her multifaceted life. The walls, adorned with sketches of landscapes born from her artistic sojourns, bear silent witness to the blossoming harmony in the air.

Seated gracefully on a familiar wooden stool, Seohee positions her cello – a cherished gift from a close friend - under her chin, breath mingling with anticipation. As her fingers dance fluidly over the ebony fingerboard, the bow caresses the strings with ethereal precision, conjuring notes that meld seamlessly with the dusky glow peeping through the windows. Each resonance captures fleeting moments of daily life – laughter shared, soft whispers of a bygone day, and dreams cradled beneath the Seoul stars.

The practice holds timeless wisdom, blending stand-alone authenticity with gentle intuition, echoing her artistry in clay or the subtlety of a perfectly tuned dental procedure. Within each variation of the Allegro, Seohee's eyes light up with triumph when discovering expressions that challenge and satiate her thirst for musical dexterity. Step by step, piece by piece, she interweaves this newfound tapestry of melodies, reborn with each practice and layered with her experiences, awaiting its premiere in a future filled with artistic promise.
