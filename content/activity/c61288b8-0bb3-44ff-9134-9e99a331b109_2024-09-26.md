Payton and Olivia explore pottery at Midtown Clay Studio, shaping bowls and memories through clay and conversation.
Payton Jackson invited Olivia Scott
The lavender-gray sky of a brisk September morning serves as the backdrop for Payton Jackson and Olivia Scott as they push open the doors of the Midtown Clay Studio. The studio is part cacophony of spinning wheels and part gallery oasis, walls adorned with the meticulously crafted results of artistic passion. The earthy aromas of clay and glaze greet them with a soulful embrace, sparking creativity with each inhale.

Today, they set aside their usual creative workshops and delve into the textured world of pottery. Payton's brow furrows with focus, just as a blip of clay slips between her fingers, reminding her of the tactile immediacy of this craft not quite like the brush and canvas. Olivia, contrasting with a playful determination, quickly adapts, turning potential mishaps into endearing imperfections on her spinning ceramic piece, each twist a nod toward the beauty inherent in irregularities.

The dialogue between friends flows as seamlessly as their hands over clay, ranging from recollections of shared artistic endeavors to Emily Dickinson's poetry—Olivia's literary influence ever surfacing. Amid laughter, they swap tales of past artistic high points, from festivals in Cleveland to poetry readings in Austin, each memory captured in fluid banter.

As two hours glide by like unfired pots on a wheel, they step back to admire their creations—bowls little foreseen yet beautifully expressive. Their jointly achieved pieces sit on a shelf, waiting for the kiln's transformative magic, which Payton comments mirrors the slow reveal of a poem in Olivia's notebook.

The studio buzz as other potters shuffle in, engaging in cheerful conversations. Payton tucks loose strands of hair back with the side of her hand, slightly damp with traces of clay, and Olivia quietly quotes, "It's the intricacy of the simple," encapsulating their morning's endeavor. With hearts full and minds ignited, they leave the studio, clay-laden hands echoing their artistic ambitions.

Payton spends a reflective afternoon writing in Central Park, inspired by nature's tranquility and her dreams of art therapy.
Payton Jackson pauses at the entrance to Central Park, her favorite writing retreat away from urban clamor. A gentle breeze tousles the auburn tendrils of her hair as she steps onto the wooded path lined with whispering leaves, feeling the day's possibilities stretch before her. Equipped with a leather-bound journal and a collection of multicolored pens, she finds a secluded nook by the Loeb Boathouse, where the lake's tranquility mirrors her quest for inner peace.

The afternoon sun casts dappled shadows through the canopy overhead, bathing her makeshift desk in warmth. Payton immerses herself in capturing the symphony of nature that waltzs around her—chirping rustles, soft footfalls of passersby, and the distant laughter of children playing beneath towering oaks. Her pen dances across the paper, stitching together fragments of dreams and hopes. Each sentence is a delicate weave of her childhood experiences, artistic endeavors, and aspirations of molding art into therapeutic healing.

Payton lets the pastoral melodies soothe her mental tapestry, pausing occasionally to listen to the world around her. In these interludes, she sketches fleeting thoughts of where art and nature intertwine in sacred observance, evoking moments of therapeutic clarity that she envisions bringing to her future clinic.

As the golden hour creeps forward, Payton pens the afternoon's final musings, her reflections echoing with gratitude and purpose. In this serene bubble of creativity, she fortifies her resolve in bringing color and compassion into the world, carrying a wellspring of inspiration back into her reality as the trees sway their soft farewell above.
