In the hush of early dawn, JiHoon Moon begins his ascent up the ancient trails of Inwangsan Mountain. The dawn kisses the horizon in hues of soft gold and crisp azure, casting long shadows that beckon him forward. This solitary hike is not just a physical journey but a soulful communion with nature, a reserved space where thoughts of mental wellness mingle with the rustle of autumn leaves underfoot.

As he climbs, the gradient stitches a dialogue between breath and body, grounding him in the moment. The path winds through a tapestry of wispy wildflowers and steadfast rock faces, their presence as aged witnesses to Seoul's unfolding story.

As he stands in this pocket of solitude, he fills every pore with the beauty of the world below and the tranquility offered by the world above.
