Hae Shin invited Mei-Lin Wu
A gentle autumn breeze ushered in Hae Shin and Mei-Lin Wu as they arrived at the Traditional Hanok Library in Seoul, an architectural ode to Korea's cultural heritage. The library's wooden facade, accentuated by intricate lattice windows, cast delicate shadows as the two friends approached with light, eager steps. Inside, a serenity wrapped around them, where the whispered turns of yellowing pages mingled with fragrant hints of aged wood.

Today's surprise poetry reading promised an intermingling of rhythmic stanzas echoing through time, resonating with modern sentiment. The allure of immersive narratives beckoned them both, a moment of pause amidst their diverse woofs and prismatic adventures.

Seated on intricate cushions scattered across the floor, Hae Shin glanced at Mei-Lin, who, inspired by the historic setting, wore a beautifully crafted hanbok infused with Taiwanese motifs. As they settled, they shared a warm anticipatory glance, their friendship quietly vibrant in the tranquil setting.

The event commenced with a poet's lilting voice weaving tales of nature, love, and life - themes that resonated deeply with Hae's nurturing spirit and Mei-Lin's creative exuberance. Mei-Lin, ever the creative, captured the room's ambiance through quick sketches on the notepad she always carried.

As stanzas flowed seamlessly, painting vivid imagery in the minds of listeners, a hush filled the library, punctuated only by thoughtful nods and occasional soft sighs of appreciation. In this haven of words and warmth, Hae found solace beyond her animal clinic, while Mei-Lin was inspired to blend such lyrical beauty into her art.

When the reading concluded, the friends lingered by a corner adorned with lanterns casting an amber glow. Here, discussions about weaving poetic grace into their respective crafts extended late into the morning, nurturing dreams that fluttered between lines of prose and threads of cloth.

Hae Shin spends an evening at Cheonggyecheon Stream, capturing the urban landscape at dusk through sketching, enveloped in the serene embrace of reflecting city lights.
As the sky painted itself in deepening hues of orange and purple, Hae Shin lounged on a stone bench beside the Cheonggyecheon Stream. The gentle flow of the water reflected shimmering city lights, creating a tapestry of movement and color that seemed almost alive. With her sketchbook in hand, Hae felt the pulse of the city synchronize with her own heartbeat, each stroke on the paper echoing the harmonious blend of nature and urbanity surrounding her. Birdsong had faded with the sun, yet the rhythmic chatter of nearby pedestrians provided a calming soundtrack, drawing her deeper into her creative world. Shadows lengthened as streetlamps flickered to life, sketching their own stories across her pages. In the solitude, memories of past activities—communal art, playful dance, and pensive meditations—wove into each fragment of the scene she captured, infusing her sketches with an essence of vivid nostalgia.
