JiHoon explores and captures the essence of Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, blending his love for photography and cultural appreciation on a solo morning walk.
The sun-painted, idyllic neighborhood of Seoul's Bukchon Hanok Village welcomed JiHoon on this crisp autumn morning. With his trusty camera nestled in hand, his adventure embarked alone yet surrounded by the ghostly echoes of stories embedded in every brick and tile. JiHoon’s footsteps resonated gently against the cobblestone paths, each stone an unwritten chapter waiting to be captured.

Harmonizing past with present, the village was an interlude of time. JiHoon was drawn eagerly to the elegantly bent rooftops of Hanoks, their traditional architecture like etchings against the perfect blue of the sky. He paused beneath the branches of Gingko trees, leaves teetering between shades of gold and green, illuminating their value in his lens. 

Each frame captured was a glimpse into life’s simpler moments—the elderly sellers arranging herbs with ritualistic care, school children whizzing past on bicycles, and artisans meticulously crafting ceramics behind open windows, all lending his photographs a vibrant narrative.

With every 'click', JiHoon saw more than the scene. He found stories to tell—ones he would echo through his budding mental health initiative, merging the visual serenity of his photographs with wellness advocacy somehow. As he slowly made his way downhill, the documenter in him rejoiced, his heart thrumming along to tales unheard and lives unseen, deep in the fabric of Bukchon.

JiHoon Moon and Haelim Su explore the ancient secrets of Korean herbs in Gangwon, sharing storytelling and sketching moments that enrich their passion for healthcare and art.
JiHoon Moon invited Chloé Martin
Amidst the lush, velvety greens of the Korean Herb Garden in Gangwon, JiHoon Moon and his friend Haelim Su embarked on an immersive exploration of ancient medicinal herbs—gathering knowledge steeped in Korea's rich history and natural wealth. Guided by the garden's curators, the air was rich with the heady aroma of freshly plucked leaves and roots, blending seamlessly with the gentle whispers of the breeze.

JiHoon, with his penchant for storytelling, narrated tales of how ginseng and tea had flourished within old Korean culture, imagining how these plants had stood witness to generations' worth of healing and metamorphosis. His voice was filled with wonder as he recounted local legends and medicinal tidbits he had learned through research.

In tandem, Haelim, naturally attracted to the yangbaraji blooms, engaged in sketching some of the more unusual specimens they encountered, intending to fuse her art with healing therapies back in Seoul. Her nimble fingers danced across the sketchpad, capturing nature's intricate lacework. Perhaps, she mused, these drawings would forge new paths in her upcoming community art center.

Beneath a towering pine tree, they paused to savor a delicate picnic, exchanging bites of rice cakes and cloves of stewed ginger, bonding through shared sips of aromatic herbal tea. Conversations flowed, each story shared—deepening the ties forged through years of collaboration and mutual admiration. As the sun began its golden descent, pulling shadowy tendrils across the garden, JiHoon imagined these precious moments weaved into his ongoing health initiative, with Haelim's vibrant drawings echoing their day's legacy in still, powerful brush strokes.

Across the digital expanse, vibrant and curious faces began to populate the screen, among them his long-time friend Chloé Martin, her determination and effervescence apparent in her smile.

Framed against the backdrop of his modestly styled home office in Seoul, JiHoon kicked off the session with an inviting smile and warm welcomes. "Today's journey," he began, "is about the canvas where visual storytelling meets mental wellness. We're going to explore how the images we capture can transcend frames and offer solace, reflection, and hope."

Chloé chimed in with her uniquely charming dual-lingual flair, adding a sprinkle of motivation. "Art isn't just visual, it's felt," she said passionately. Throughout their discussion, she demonstrated calming breathing techniques, seamlessly synchronizing them with JiHoon's photographs—a serene juxtaposition of Seoul's autumnal beauty, captured just the day before in Bukchon Hanok Village.

As the duo exchanged ideas with the virtual audience, a sense of harmony unfurled. JiHoon shared images that showcased life's intricate beauty, offering glimpses of elderly vendors, bustling youth, and meticulous artisans. Chloé, in tandem, guided participants through mindful exercises, weaving artistry and mental clarity into an uplifting meditation.
