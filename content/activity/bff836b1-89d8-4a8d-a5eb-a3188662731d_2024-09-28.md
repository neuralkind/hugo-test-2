JiYong spends the morning in profound reflection and solitude, perfecting his carpentry skills in his home workshop. His efforts are inspired by the fusion of tradition and modern design.
As the sun flirted with the beginnings of dawn, casting shimmering patterns on the walls of JiYong's intimate workshop, he felt a sense of excitement fill the crisp morning air. The small, yet bustling quarters whispered tales of wood, solitary musings, and caffeinated mornings stretched thin. 

Today was a dedicated journey into the realm of refined craftsmanship, an exploration of wooden grains and creative expression. JiYong allowed himself to immerse in the symphony of solitude. The familiar scent of freshly cut wood mingled with faint notes of sandalwood incense, a scent that wistfully transported him back to Busan’s serene sands. 

With the rhythmic whirl of the lathe and the precise hum of the jigsaw, JiYong embarked upon creating something meaningful. His fingers traced the intricate patterns of the oak slabs, channeling his aspirations for designing a unique coffee table inspired by Busan's coastal elegance. Each tap of the mallet and sweep of the chisel perfectly echoed the internal harmony he cherished. 

JiYong's movements were more than just practiced; they were poetic, weaving past memories with this tangible present. He danced through technique and tradition, crafting art from memory, producing surfaces with seamless finishes, ensuring no edge remained unchecked. Through the gentle embrace of his tools— each swish, scrape, and polish—, he forged a connection both profound and spiritual, subtly bridging the world of creation and reflection. 

As the clock ticked towards the later hours of the morning, and natural light painted the workshop’s floor with golden strokes, JiYong took a deep breath. Satisfied with the metamorphosis of raw material to refined creation, he relished in his evolved craftsmanship, all while dreaming of the day when patrons would admire his creations at a quaint beachside café.

JiYong Choi and Andrew Allen brainstormed a beachside café design, blending storytelling and cultural themes into the concept. They shared creative ideas over coffee in a cozy Seoul café, weaving their visions into a unified blueprint.
Rain was dancing on the café's windows in gentle cascades, imbuing the cozy Seoul café with an intimate warmth against the chill of early autumn. Seated at a corner table, dusty sketches, mood boards, and notebooks lay spread across the polished surface between JiYong Choi and Andrew Allen. JiYong, his fingers entwined with the handle of a rich caramel latte, spoke passionately about his vision for a welcoming beachside retreat — a café where stories thread like sea breezes through every conversation. Across from him, Andrew listened intently, his eyes alight with anticipation as he sketched potential layouts — reading nooks here and a storytelling corner there.

The dialogue ebbed and flowed like tides as they swapped visions, folding Andrew’s rich storytelling heritage into design touches, like mural ideas featuring tales from New Orleans. Over shared slices of carrot cake, Andrew proposed immersive live storytelling sessions, entangled with JiYong's dream to blend cultural vibrancies into the menu — zesty coastal snacks paired with warm, aromatic teas. Between sips of coffee and laughter, Andrew envisioned a 'Stories Bench’ by the windows, where visitors could scribe snippets of their own narratives for others to read. Through metaphoric and literal sketches, their ideas began to form contours, breathing life into the blueprint of JiYong's longstanding dream — a harmonious space echoing with laughter, aroma, music, and cultural tales.

The synergy between Haelim's calm, nurturing guidance, and JungKyu's invigorating oration transformed the ordinary room into a dynamic tapestry of creativity.

Their collective energy and laughter echoed harmoniously, each brush stroke and poetic verse a testament to the healing power of companionship and creativity.
