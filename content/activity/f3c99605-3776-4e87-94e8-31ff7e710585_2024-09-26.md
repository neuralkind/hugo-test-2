Charles Kelly invited Yan Bai
Amidst the fragrant bouquet of spices and simmering sauces, Charles Kelly and Yan Bai enter the vibrant Culinary Institute in San Francisco. The aroma of fresh herbs mingles with the sound of sizzling garlic, and the atmosphere is charged with culinary excitement. Today, their quest involves a deep dive into the art of gourmet cooking, a shared passion that promises to tantalize their taste buds and broaden their culinary skills.

As they don aprons, Yan recalls techniques from her grandmother's traditional recipes, while Charles channels his creativity from jazz improvisation into the kitchen. They station themselves at a polished counter, surrounded by colorful ingredients awaiting transformation.

The workshop begins under the guidance of a lively chef, who encourages them to blend classic techniques with their own unique flair. Charles, ever inquisitive, asks about the science behind emulsifying sauces, while Yan takes to experimenting by adding a dash of spice into a creamy risotto. Laughter ensues when Charles accidentally flambés more than just the crème brûlée, his eyes wide with astonishment, the dessert miraculously saved under Yan's steady hand.

Their banter mirrors their evolving friendship, a steady melody against the rhythm of chopping knives. As they plate their final creations—a seared scallops dish with a citrus glaze and a visually striking saffron-infused paella—Charles and Yan exchange a nod of satisfaction and anticipation. It's a crescendo of flavors and smells, a memory interwoven with camaraderie and curiosity.

As the lesson concludes, they savor each bite, flavors unfolding with the richness of their shared history, hinting at future culinary adventures to come. Beneath the culinary institute’s warm glow, today’s lesson isn’t just about cooking—it's a celebration of friendship and the transformative power of creating together.

Yan explores a captivating fusion of art and technology at the Museum of the Moving Image, sparking inspiration for her creative pursuits.
Yan Bai breathed in the fresh morning air as she approached the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, her pace quickened by anticipation. Today's agenda revolved around immersing herself in the innovative cross-section of art and technology—a venture to spark fresh inspiration for her burgeoning photography and weaving interests. The museum's façade glistened under the September sun, hinting at the creativity harbored within its walls.

Stepping through the entrance, Yan was instantly absorbed by a kinetic sculpture that seemed to defy gravity—a hypnotic dance of lights and shadows capturing her analytical mind. She moved from one exhibit to another, each blending digital wizardry with creative finesse, all while casting new perspectives on the interaction between art and everyday technology.

One installation, an interactive hologram exhibit, caught her attention completely. Here, visitors could manipulate light into ever-changing forms, echoing Yan's love for playing with photographic exposures. She gleefully tried her hand, fascinated by the endless possibilities, her mind already envisaging how she might incorporate similar techniques into her own creative projects.

Adjacent to the holograms was a corridor showcasing a series of short films embodying dystopian futures and utopian potentials. The cinematic musing reminded Yan of her own dreams for educational change, stirring her motivation to further her non-profit aspirations. The muted hum of projectors in the background mirrored her thoughts, sparking ideas that circled and expanded in her ever-seeking mind.

Two hours slipped by unnoticed until a glance at her watch reminded her of the fleeting nature of time. Yan felt invigorated as she left the museum, the marriage of art and technology resonating deeply with her, leaving her mind alight with newfound creative energy and clarity.

Yan Bai enjoys a serene solo reading retreat at the New Watson Library, indulging in a rich anthology of stories while finding solace and inspiration in the tranquil surroundings.
As the late afternoon sun filtered through the soaring arched windows of the New Watson Library, Yan Bai arrived with a perceptible air of tranquility. This library, an epitome of modern architectural elegance nestled in the heart of Midtown, was her chosen sanctuary for today's retreat into literary landscapes. Leaving behind the bustling energy of New York City streets, Yan stepped through the towering glass doors, greeted by an inviting hush that encased the voluminous room.

Deep wooden bookshelves, lined with a myriad of spines ranging from timeless classics to contemporary masterpieces, whispered promises of scribes and stories waiting to unfurl. Yan instinctively selected a secluded corner by a sprawling oak bookshelf, its rich mahogany surface emanating warmth and quiet wisdom. Here, she was enveloped by the comforting scents of aged paper and freshly brewed coffee, wafting in from a nearby café within the library.

Cradling an anthology of short stories and her signature green tea, Yan nestled into a plush armchair that seemed to hug her weary soul. The pages turned at a steady rhythm, each flip accompanied by a gentle rustle as her mind journeyed through fantastical universes and poignant reflections. Every story unfolded a new dimension: a Dickensian figure wandering rain drenched streets, tales colored by the vibrant Khmer culture, and haunting narratives that etched indelible marks upon her heart.

As time slipped by unseen, Yan indulged in the quiet luxury of solitude—a stark contrast to her otherwise numbers-driven existence—engaging fully with the characters and worlds spun by the writers’ craft. In this suspended reality, she found both solace and renewed inspiration to fuel her aspirations for wider horizons.

As dusk began to cloak the city outside, Yan, soul nourished and senses alight, marked her page with a sense of reluctance. She rose slowly, taking a moment to gaze appreciatively at the sanctuary that had offered her refuge. Her footsteps left gentle echoes as she made her way towards the exit, thoughts still lingering in the myriad passages her afternoon had unveiled.
