Jade Cruz invited Payton Jackson
As the sun dips behind New York's formidable skyline, casting long shadows on the hustling streets, Jade Cruz and Payton Jackson make their way to the Wave Wellness Centre for an evening of Aqua Yoga. The center is a sanctuary of calm amidst urban chaos, with its serene blue interior lit softly by underwater lights that mimic the rhythm of rippling waves.

Upon arrival, they’re greeted by the soothing scent of eucalyptus and the gentle hum of ambient music. The pool, a tranquil oasis, gently laps against its azure edges as if beckoning them to dive into its embrace.

Payton, with her background in art therapy, appreciates the harmonizing aspects of the environment, commenting on the subtle interplay of lights and reflections that create a living canvas. Jade, always on the lookout for inspiration, absorbs these nuances with a keen eye, contemplating them for her sketches.

The session begins with their instructor guiding them through a series of movements. Buoyant and weightless, the friends glide through peaceful sequences, feeling tension melt away like New York's summer haze fading into evening coolness.

Jade finds joy in the fluidity, her construction-honed skills subtly influencing her balance and control on the water’s shifting surface. Beside her, Payton gracefully mirrors the postures, drawing on her affinity for mindfulness, each movement a brushstroke echoing her sophisticated composure.

They exchange encouraging smiles between breaths, drawing strength from their friendship and the peaceful energy surrounding them. As the session concludes, their spirits are lifted, bodies invigorated by the water's embrace, and minds clear from the day's struggles, plotting ideas for their future joint creative endeavors right there by the poolside.
