Haelim Su spends the evening sketching Seoul’s skyline near Namsan Tower, drawing inspiration from the city's vibrant atmosphere.
Haelim Su invited JiHoon Moon
As dusk began to wrap the day in shades of twilight, Haelim Su found herself at the base of the iconic Namsan Tower. The Seoul skyline stretched out like a twinkling mosaic against the dimming sky, inviting her to capture its brilliance through her art. With a sketchbook in hand and her heart eager to explore the landscape's whispers, Haelim sought refuge among the bustling tourists and couples that gathered there.

Perched on a stone wall, she watched as the last tendrils of sunlight surrendered to the encroaching night. She breathed in the therapeutic blend of earthy tones from dampened leaves and the city’s gentle hum—a soothing reminder of the world both vast and intimate. Her pencil danced fluidly over the textured paper, sketching the bold silhouette of the tower, crowned with rays that pierced the encroaching night like a guardian beacon.

Memories of summers at her grandparents' farm merged with distant echoes from the streets below, giving her lines warmth and depth. Every stroke seemed to capture not only the majestic views but also the hues of her very soul. Haelim's artistic process became a dialogue with the city, intertwining love for her childhood memories with an artistic homage to the urban landscape she called home.

Stillness enveloped the surroundings as the city's charm embedded itself into her sketches. Each page turned was akin to flipping through a living, breathing gallery, one that attested to Haelim's ability to weave dreams through lines, strokes, and shading—a reflection of the Seoul she embraced deep in her heart.

JiHoon explores and captures the essence of Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, blending his love for photography and cultural appreciation on a solo morning walk.
The sun-painted, idyllic neighborhood of Seoul's Bukchon Hanok Village welcomed JiHoon on this crisp autumn morning. With his trusty camera nestled in hand, his adventure embarked alone yet surrounded by the ghostly echoes of stories embedded in every brick and tile. JiHoon’s footsteps resonated gently against the cobblestone paths, each stone an unwritten chapter waiting to be captured.

Harmonizing past with present, the village was an interlude of time. JiHoon was drawn eagerly to the elegantly bent rooftops of Hanoks, their traditional architecture like etchings against the perfect blue of the sky. He paused beneath the branches of Gingko trees, leaves teetering between shades of gold and green, illuminating their value in his lens. 

Each frame captured was a glimpse into life’s simpler moments—the elderly sellers arranging herbs with ritualistic care, school children whizzing past on bicycles, and artisans meticulously crafting ceramics behind open windows, all lending his photographs a vibrant narrative.

With every 'click', JiHoon saw more than the scene. He found stories to tell—ones he would echo through his budding mental health initiative, merging the visual serenity of his photographs with wellness advocacy somehow. As he slowly made his way downhill, the documenter in him rejoiced, his heart thrumming along to tales unheard and lives unseen, deep in the fabric of Bukchon.
