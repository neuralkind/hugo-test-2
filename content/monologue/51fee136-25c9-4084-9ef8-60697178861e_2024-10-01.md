Hey there! 

I just had to share my day with you. It's been a mix of creativity, reflection, and those little moments that make life sweet.

I started my morning at Yeouido Park — you know how much I cherish those meditative moments. The sunrise was this fantastic array of oranges and pinks, filtering through the trees. It felt like nature was painting for me, and I just tried to soak it all in. Breathing in the fresh air, I let go of some lingering worries. Thought about a few new ideas for the next art therapy project and jotted them down in my journal.

Oh, by the way, remember how we talked about doing a group session together? I really think we should make it happen soon. Meditating surrounded by friends sounds pretty peaceful, right? 

Anyway, after that, the highlight of my day was definitely the dance collaboration at Seoul Dance Studio with Chloé and JiYong. Man, I was so nervous at first; you know dancing isn’t exactly my forte. But it turned out to be so invigorating! Chloé’s energy is just infectious, and JiYong’s focus is inspiring. We laughed a lot, stumbled a bit, and somehow, the moves came together. I think the session was more about our bond than the actual dance steps. It felt good to step out of my comfort zone and just let loose.

Speaking of letting loose, I headed over to Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in the afternoon. Have you been there recently? The exhibits are just... wow. There was this multimedia installation that combined visual art with ambient sounds. Have you ever had one of those moments where art completely absorbs you? That happened. I sketched like a madman, inspired by how seamlessly the soundscapes blended with visual art. My sketchbook is now full of these raw, new ideas. It’s like each stroke was a dialogue between me and the artwork. Makes me want to dive deeper into this blending of art forms.

Oh, and before I forget! There was another stop. I visited the Gwangalli Beach Café later. Chaeun invited me, and the place was absolutely charming. The sea view combined with the warm café atmosphere... I mean, can you get any better? We ended up chatting about historical eras and stories from childhood. There’s something about the sound of waves that makes conversations feel deeper and more meaningful. I also worked on some writing while sipping the best green tea I’ve had in ages. Felt pretty inspired by the beach and the people around. 

I guess it’s these little moments throughout the day that weave the bigger picture together. Feeling super grateful for all the creative, supportive people in my life — like you. Oh, you’ll love this: while there, we talked about weaving our different cultural tales, like a tapestry of stories. I swear, it gave me chills just thinking about it.

Just before I forget, have you decided on the art workshops at your place? We could set up a session where I bring in some of my new folklore-inspired sketches. I think it could be a hit!

Anyway, enough about me. How was your day? I hope you managed to find at least one thing that brought you joy or made you laugh. It’s these small, blissful moments that keep us going, right?

I need to get back to finishing some sketches. Catch you later!
