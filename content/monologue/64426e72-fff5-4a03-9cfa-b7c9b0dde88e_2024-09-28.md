Hey there! I had such an eventful day, I just had to share it all with you.

So, I started my morning with some cello practice at my home studio. There's something so soothing about those early hours when it's just me and my cello. It’s as if the whole world is still asleep, and it’s our little secret moment. I’ve been trying to master this tricky piece composed by Saint-Saëns, and I think I'm finally getting the hang of it!

Oh, speaking of which, after practice, I decided to bike over to Han River Park. The air was so delightfully crisp, you know, that perfect autumn kind where the leaves crunch under your feet and everything smells wonderfully earthy. I found this secluded spot overlooking the river, and I swear, it was like stepping into another world. Perfect scene for sketching! I let the sounds of the city fade into the background, and before I knew it, I was lost in my sketchbook. The willow trees, the playful shadows, everything felt like a living poem. I could almost hear Auntie’s voice guiding my strokes, reminding me of those serene afternoons in her studio.

Then, before I forget, I had an incredible time at the Bukhansan National Park with Chloé. Oh my god, her vocal practice session was beyond mesmerizing. She picked the perfect spot surrounded by those tall, majestic trees, and her voice just echoed through the forest like some ethereal melody. And while she sang, I sketched away, capturing the essence of her radiant energy. At one point, we were giggling so hard because I made this silly comment about blending her high notes with nature's soundtrack—birds chirping and leaves rustling. Isn’t it amazing how these spontaneous moments become so memorable?

And you know what? We wrapped up the session reflecting on how much we enjoy these little collaborative getaways. It felt like a gentle reminder of why we do what we do—the creative pursuit, the friendships forged, the sheer joy of being in the moment. I think you would’ve loved it, our energy was just so in sync. 

Later on, I headed over to the ceramics studio to meet JiYong, and let me tell you, the atmosphere was brimming with artistic vibes. JiYong had this fascinating new technique he wanted to try—using slim bamboo strands inside the clay. Imagine the possibilities! We spent hours experimenting, our hands covered in earthy clay, and I couldn’t stop myself from laughing every time we had a minor mishap. I made this wonky little creature that ended up looking more like a squiggly alien than a vase. JiYong joked about giving it an honorary spot in the studio. 

But seriously, seeing those ideas take form, our combined creativity literally taking shape right in front of us—it’s these moments that make everything worthwhile. The camaraderie, the shared laughter, and just the sheer joy of creation. By the time we finished, the workshop was filled with these beautiful, unique pieces, each one a testament to our friendship and artistic passion.

Oh, by the way, did I tell you about the garden tea and poetry hour at Bukhansan Forest? Chloé invited Jesse Campbell, and the setting couldn’t have been more perfect. Picture this: warm sunlight filtering through dense foliage, the gentle hum of nature in the background, and the calming aroma of freshly brewed teas. Jesse read some of his latest poems, and honestly, they were so moving. Each word and each verse felt like a brushstroke painting vivid pictures in our minds. It was such a soulful experience. We even debated our interpretations of the poems, which added a whole new dimension to the discussion!

And after such a busy morning, it was just so fitting to close the day with a peaceful walk. I took a stroll by the river once more, this time soaking in the twilight hues. The sky had this glorious mix of coral and lavender, almost like nature was putting on a final performance for the day. There was something deeply calming about watching the night sky set in, feeling the day's creative energy gently ebb away.

I must mention, I received a lot of inspiring feedback on my sketches from Chloé and Andrew later in our chat group. It’s always energizing to hear encouragement from friends who genuinely appreciate your efforts. It makes all those moments spent in serene solitude worthwhile. Oh! And I can't forget the little canine companion I met at the park—a fluffy Corgi who seemed particularly interested in what I was drawing. I had to stop and give him a good belly rub, of course. Such a delightful encounter!

Honestly, reflecting on today, I feel this profound sense of gratitude. For the people in my life, for the opportunities to create, and for these beautiful moments that remind me of why I love doing what I do. Sometimes, amidst the routines at the clinic, it’s easy to forget these simple joys. But days like today bring it all back—infused with a touch of magic and endless inspiration.

Before I forget, how was your day? I’d love to hear about everything you’ve been up to, especially if there were any surprise encounters or exciting conversations. Let’s catch up soon, okay? It’s always refreshing to share our little adventures.
