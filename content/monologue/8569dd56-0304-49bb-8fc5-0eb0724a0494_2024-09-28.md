Hey there,

Hope you're doing well! Let me tell you about my day. So, I started off with my usual yoga session by the river. The tranquility of the place always gets me into the perfect headspace. I could feel the morning sun slowly warming up the day, and the gentle sound of the river was just so calming. I think it might’ve been my best session yet—pure zen! Afterward, I took a bit of time to just soak it all in before I headed back. 

Speaking of heading back, I had a solo soundtrack composition session at my home studio right after. It felt so good to immerse myself in music, getting lost in creating harmonies and rhythms. I've been playing around with some new sounds and themes, and I think I might be onto something exciting. Maybe I could share a snippet with you later? I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. 

Oh, and before I forget, this afternoon was really special! I had a tea and poetry hour at Bukhansan Forest with Jesse and Seohee. It was more magical than I imagined. We found this cozy spot surrounded by trees and flowers, and we just shared our creative work. Jesse brought some really thought-provoking poems, and Seohee’s sketches were, as always, outstanding. It was one of those moments where time just seemed to stand still, you know? We laughed a lot too, probably disrupting the forest peace with our giggles and stories. 

But you know what was even crazier? We spontaneously decided to go to Han Riverside for an artistic video shoot in the evening. Jesse tagged along, and it was so much fun! The sunset was beyond beautiful—like the sky got painted with this brilliant palette of reds and oranges. It set the perfect mood for the shoot. The water glistening under the twilight, the city lights slowly coming to life—it was just perfect. Jesse’s got some great behind-the-scenes footage, which I can’t wait to check out. 

Oh, and there's a funny story. At one point, I almost tripped over a camera stand because I got too excited about this cool new dance move. We all had a good laugh about it, and it actually gave me some fresh energy to get back to the shoot. Sometimes, these little mishaps make the best memories.

Also, I got to chat with a few local artists at the Art Seoul Gallery this evening. I went right after our shoot. There was this incredible exhibit blending Korean tradition with French modern art. I felt like I was walking through a visual symphony. One piece, in particular, really got to me—it was called "Harmony in Diversity." It spoke so clearly about blending different cultures into something beautiful and unified. Reminded me a lot of my journey and how I’ve been trying to integrate different elements into my music and dance. 

I took a few photos there too—couldn't resist capturing some of the inspiration to keep for later. Maybe I’ll send you a few. There was this one artist who I had a fantastic conversation with. We talked about how our past experiences shape our art, and it got me thinking more deeply about my own work and the stories I want to tell through it.

So, after this mix of creativity and fun, I decided to unwind with some K-Dramas. Needed something light-hearted after such an eventful day. The lead characters are hilarious, and honestly, it’s the perfect way to just relax and not think too hard about anything. Tonight’s episode had a really funny mix-up that had me laughing so hard!

Oh, also wanted to mention how seeing everyone this evening filled me with such positive energy. It’s incredible how a simple gathering can recharge your spirit. Makes all the hard work and long hours worth it when you have moments like these to look forward to.

Alright, before I ramble on forever, I need to get back to jotting down some ideas that sparked today. It’s been such a vibrant and enriching day, and I’m so grateful for every moment. Let’s catch up soon, maybe over some tea or a walk by the river? I’d love to hear about what you’ve been up to. 

**Catch you later!**
