Hey there!

Oh my goodness, today was such an adventure. So many little things happened that I just have to tell you about. I started my morning as usual, with yoga in the garden. The sunrise painted the sky in these beautiful shades of coral and gold – seriously, it was like nature's own masterpiece. After the yoga session, I felt so in tune with everything around me, as if the whole world was just one big, harmonious space.

Then, I had this incredible birdwatching workshop at Haneul Park. You know how excited I get about these things! There were so many fellow enthusiasts, and we saw a stunning variety of birds. There was this one bird, maybe a kingfisher, with the most vibrant plumage I’ve ever seen! It was like seeing a fragment of a rainbow up close. Watching it made me feel so grateful for moments of pure beauty in our everyday lives. I can't wait to tell you more about the different species we spotted when we catch up in person.

After that, a quick coffee stop at my favorite downtown café was absolutely necessary. I had this perfect cup of green tea, which always reminds me of our college days, back when we'd spend hours just chatting away in little corners of Cambridge cafés. Funny how some drinks can transport you back in time, right? Anyway, it was one of those places where creativity just flows. I jotted down some ideas for my next article while enjoying the ambiance.

Oh, and Jesse joined me later for some evening nature photography at Seoul Forest. We had such a serene walk. The light filtering through the trees was magical, perfect for some amazing shots. We found this spot by the river that seemed untouched by time – so peaceful and serene. I got some incredible photos of a swan gliding across the water. Jesse, being his artistic self, was sketching away and came up with the most beautiful representation of the scene. It was like seeing the world through a different lens. We chatted about how art and nature are so deeply intertwined, and it felt rejuvenating. Truly, there’s something so enriching about sharing these moments with someone who appreciates them just as much as you do.

You know what else? Jesse shared this sketch he did at the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art. He’d visited it earlier in the day and was so inspired by a multimedia exhibit. The sketch was stunning, filled with intricate details and bold strokes, entirely capturing the essence of what he experienced. It made me realize how we all see the world uniquely, and art is such a beautiful way to express it. Makes me wonder what new perspectives we could uncover if we took that museum trip together sometime.

Now, here’s something amusing! I talked to Seohee during her epic potluck and carpentry demo. She told me about the kimchi pancakes she made – I was practically drooling through the phone! Honestly, she makes traditional Korean dishes sound like gourmet art. Then she mentioned this new ceramics technique she tried with JiYong. Can you believe they used bamboo strands? I’m so excited to see the final pieces. It sounds incredibly intricate and unique.

Oh, speaking of unique, Andrew and Neha’s storytelling session at Café Bene went so well. They have this way of weaving historical narratives that just transports you. I couldn’t attend, but Neha filled me in and I could almost feel like I was there, sipping on coffee and getting lost in their stories. Definitely a “wish you were here” kind of moment! By the way, Andrew is planning to feature some of those stories in his next podcast episode. I think listening to it will be the perfect way to unwind this weekend. I'll keep you posted on when it goes live!

Before I forget, I also did some gratitude journaling in the evening. It’s become such a grounding part of my routine. Today, I found myself reflecting on our friendship a lot. Thinking about how many adventures we’ve shared and the dreams we’ve discussed. It’s moments like these that make me feel so connected and thankful for having you in my life.

And while I’m on the topic of gratitude, thank you for always being so supportive. I was reading through some of our old messages and realized how much your words of encouragement have helped me, especially through stressful times. You’re definitely a pillar of strength, and I can’t wait for us to plan our next escapade. Perhaps another one of those serene retreats we love so much? Bali was so perfect last time, and I’m sure we could find another gem somewhere.

Before I sign off, I must tell you about JungKyu’s poetry recital. His words are truly magical. Neha and Chloé were there, and it felt like we were being transported to different worlds through his poems. He has this way of making each line resonate deeply. We had a little chat afterward, and he was so appreciative of everyone’s support. If you haven’t heard his latest work, you absolutely have to. It’s simply captivating.

Alright, I think that’s most of what happened today. Every day brings its own little adventures, doesn’t it? And sharing them with you makes them even more special. You always make everything feel brighter and more meaningful.

I should probably get going now, got a few things to wrap up. Catch you later!
