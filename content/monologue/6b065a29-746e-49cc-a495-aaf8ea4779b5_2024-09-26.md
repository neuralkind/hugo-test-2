Hey, it's JiHoon. Hope you're doing well! 

So, I've got to tell you about my morning. I decided to take a stroll to Bukchon Hanok Village. Man, that place is something else. I think about how I've wandered there a million times, but each visit feels like sinking into a different chapter of an old, well-loved book. Today, with my camera in hand, I was determined to capture some of that magic. You know, the kind that makes you stop and think about how many stories these places have seen. 

The light was perfect, kind of like the village was showing off just for me. I got this shot of an elderly lady meticulously arranging herbs outside her tiny shop—one of those moments you feel privileged to witness, you know? And the colors! The gingko trees were practically glowing gold, and the rooftops of the Hanoks looked almost like black ink paintings against the clear sky. Not gonna lie, it kind of felt like stepping into a time machine but without the sci-fi complications.

Oh, speaking of nostalgia, remember when we used to have those dumpling feasts back in the day? Well, I had this cool workshop with Chloé in the afternoon. We decided to combine dumpling making with a bit of creativity. It was hilarious. Imagine dumplings that looked like little works of art—some even too cute to eat! There was one that looked like a rabbit, another like a sunflower. Trust me, you’d have loved it. We couldn't stop laughing, and Chloé kept teasing me that I was putting too much effort into making them Instagram-worthy. Guilty as charged, right?

I also spent the early evening by the Han River, reading some poetry. There's something almost meditative about the flow of the river combined with the rhythm of words. It felt grounding, like I could just let the day wash over me and breathe it all in. I got a bit nostalgic, honestly. Gave me a chance to reflect on some things.

You know, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how photography and wellness just naturally fit together. It's like capturing these little slices of life, these quiet moments, somehow makes the chaotic bits less overwhelming. And then, I had this thought—what if we merge this idea into the mental health initiative I've been working on? I mean, visual storytelling mixed with wellness practices could be a game-changer, right? Just some food for thought, but I'd love to hear what you think about it.

Oh, by the way, I had a random but lovely chat with Haelim during our mini herb garden trip. She's been really into sketching these days—said she might start incorporating more medicinal plants into her artwork. She's got an eye for detail, and her sketches are just so calming. We shared some stewed ginger and rice cakes under a massive pine tree. Honestly, it was one of those little moments that feels monumental in hindsight. She’s thinking of fusing her art with some healing concepts back in Seoul. I'm super excited to see where she takes it.

On a lighter note, I have to share this bit of absurdity. So, I was making dinner, trying to recreate this Indian dish Neha suggested during Andrew's cultural cuisine gathering. Let’s just say, my kitchen now smells like a spice bomb detonated. The flavors were all over the place, but it was delicious chaos if that makes sense. Sometimes, my culinary experiments go sideways, but the fun is in the attempt, right?

You know what’s hilarious? Andrew was giving me a hard time about the mess I made in the kitchen. He’s been on this clean-living streak since his sunrise photo session at Namsan Park. We were joking about how photography lets us steal little moments of peace in an otherwise chaotic world.

Chloé is planning another vocal session at Rosewood Theater. Thought about joining in? Might be a great way to unwind while getting that sweet auditory therapy. Jesse was raving about how fantastic the last session was. Ah, the joys of being surrounded by artistic spirits!

Anyway, I better get a move on. Got some edits to do on the photos from today, and, not gonna lie, my bed is calling my name louder by the minute.

**Need to get back to work on those photo edits. Catch you later!**
