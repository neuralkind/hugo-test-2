Hey there! Just wanted to pop in and share a bit about my day. You know how I started with some piano improvisation this morning? It was the perfect way to set the tone for the day. The sunlight streaming in through the windows, a warm cup of tea by my side—it was almost magical. I let my fingers dance on the keys, and for a while, it felt like I was back in Sydney, those memories just wafting in through the music. It was really therapeutic, to be honest!

Anyway, after that serene start, I headed off to the Seoul Art Studio. Neha and I attended this incredible artistic expression workshop. It was packed with creative energy, you wouldn't believe it! There were so many inspiring people sharing different forms of art. I dabbled a bit in sketching—nothing too grand, but it felt good to step out of my usual realm of words and music. Neha, of course, was in her element, painting up a storm. We even discussed how the mixed cultures of Seoul and her Indian roots blend into her artwork. She has such an eye for infusing her heritage into everything she does; it really opened my mind to new possibilities for my own creations.

Later in the evening, we had our poetry recital at the Cozy Book Café. Oh my, it was splendid! The place was brimming with this quiet yet electric anticipation, you know? I poured my heart into my recitations, sharing verses inspired by my travels. It felt amazing to see people’s faces light up as I spoke about Sydney’s ocean views and Tokyo’s cherry blossoms. Neha’s support was invaluable, as always. She’s like the silent backbone in these moments of artistic vulnerability. Some poems were met with contemplative silence, others with applause and even a few tears—I swear I saw a tear or two!

After the recital, the plan was to unwind, so Neha and I decided to take an evening stroll along the Han River. That place always has this peaceful vibe that sort of washes your worries away. We talked about the day, our plans, shared some small jokes. There’s something incredibly grounding about walking alongside a flowing river, isn’t there? I think it’s the rhythm of the water; it syncs up with your thoughts and you end up feeling a lot clearer, more at peace.

Toward the end of our walk, Neha mentioned she had some fresh script ideas for the podcast she's working on with Andrew. Their discussion over lunch apparently brewed up some fascinating cultural blends. I love when creativity flows from one interaction to another! It’s like watching a spark turn into a gentle, warming fire. 

Speaking of which, Andrew’s solo morning shoot at Namsan Park sounded pretty epic too! He’s been on a roll lately, capturing those sunrise moments. I can’t wait to see what shots he’s picked as potential podcast covers. The way he frames the city waking up—it’s like seeing Seoul through a fresh lens every time.

Oh, by the way, Chloé and Seohee had their usual dynamic morning as well. Chloé’s sunrise yoga must’ve been something! She always finds the zen moments so early in the day; I honestly admire that about her. And then Seohee, blending her cello practice with an art session—how does she even do it? Maybe we should convince her to teach us some multitasking magic someday, haha. 

Before I forget, the evening at Han River Park was capped off with some delightful revelations. We ran into a couple of old friends, which led to impromptu mini discussions about organizing a larger meetup soon. The idea of all of us hanging out there someday sounds fantastic. Remember our last picnic? The laughter, the games, the stories—it’s about time we recreate those memories. What do you think?

Oh, and Chaeun had an intense day at the clinic but still found time for a quick chat. Balancing between work, creative writing, and social life; that's some next-level multitasking. I must get some tips from her on how to keep everything in sync. She’s planning to dive back into her historical fiction project tonight, which sounds pretty intriguing. Maybe next time we can get a sneak peek into those tales!

I’ll let you in on a little secret—there’s something profoundly satisfying about these varied experiences. From the serene piano session to the vibrant art workshop, to the heartfelt poetry recital, and finally, the tranquil river walk, it's like living different lifetimes in one day. Each moment leaves its own unique stamp on the heart and mind, making the day feel incredibly full and rich.

You know, this reminded me of those childhood days with our families in Gyeongju, going on hikes and exploring new places. The same warm sense of community and exploration seems to echo in my life even now, and I’m grateful for it every single day.

**Alright, I think I’ve rambled on enough for now. Just wanted to share these little slices of life with you. I need to get back to some work, but let's catch up more soon! Bye!**
