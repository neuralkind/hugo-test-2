Hey there! 

Oh my goodness, I had such an amazing day, and I couldn't wait to tell you all about it. You know how I've been trying to find some peace and quiet amidst the chaos of our training schedule? Well, this morning, I started my day with a solo meditation session at Riverside Park. There's something so soothing about being in nature at the crack of dawn. The air was crisp, and you could hear the river trickling nearby. It was the perfect backdrop for some deep reflection. I felt every ounce of stress just melt away with each inhale and exhale. Honestly, I think this might become a regular thing for me.

After that peaceful start, I headed to the Seoul Arts District for a rather special open-air vocal session at the Rosewood Theater. Can you believe Seohee joined me? She brought along her sketchpad, and oh my, her sketches just brought this extra layer of magic to the whole practice. There's something about how she captures the essence of a moment that just leaves me in awe. We had a good laugh between melodies, and it felt like we were creating a mix of art and harmony. It was just one of those mornings where everything felt perfectly in sync.

You know what's funny? As soon as we finished, I realized just how hungry I was! We didn’t stop for a snack, so by the time we wrapped up, I was practically starving. I grabbed a quick bite and then headed over to Bukchon Village for this artistic dumpling workshop with JiHoon. Yeah, dumplings and art! Can't get much better than that, right? JiHoon has such a knack for making these sessions fun and educational. We learned about different folding techniques, and it was a hilarious mess at first, but eventually, we got the hang of it. And let me tell you, those dumplings were absolutely delicious. I might have to recreate them for our next hangout!

In the afternoon, Seohee and I had this virtual art discussion. We were diving into beachside café designs, and oh, the ideas we brainstormed! It’s like the ocean breeze sneaked into our concepts and filled them with this vibrant, fresh energy. I can't wait to see how these ideas will blossom. Maybe we can even check out some of these café spots once everything's finalized. Wouldn't that be awesome?

As the day started winding down, I had this wonderful evening yoga session on my rooftop terrace. It was the perfect way to just breathe and stretch out all the tension from the day. There's something about doing yoga with the sunset painting the sky in hues of gold and crimson that just feels so right. I could see the Seoul skyline bathed in that gorgeous light, and it just filled me with this overwhelming sense of gratitude. Besides, after stuffing myself with those dumplings, I really needed a good stretch!

Oh, and before I forget, I bumped into some local artists at an art exhibition earlier! The evening was filled with such dynamic pieces, blending Korean tradition with some avant-garde French influences. Isn't that such a parallel to my own cultural journey? We had some really deep conversations about art and music, and I even managed to capture some moments with my camera. Got some ideas brewing for future projects already!

I can’t believe how motivated and inspired I feel today. It’s amazing how much a day filled with creativity and good company can recharge your spirit. I hope we get to catch up soon. I miss our little coffee dates and sharing ideas face-to-face. Do you have any fun plans coming up? Let me know. I’m always looking for new inspiration and adventures to embark on.

Anyway, I need to get back to a bit of prep work for tomorrow. Catch you later! Bye!
