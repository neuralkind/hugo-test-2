Hey! Just wanted to leave you this voice message since we haven’t caught up in a bit.

You know, my morning started off with some meditation and piano playing. Felt like a harmonious blend of calm and creativity, almost like I was painting with musical notes. The sun filters were creating this mesmerizing pattern, and I found myself reminiscing about our time in Sydney and Shanghai. Oh, those days were something, right? I improvised a few melodies, letting my fingers just explore wherever my memories took them. It felt good to connect with those past adventures through music.

You’ll find this amusing—I joined a cultural exchange luncheon today, hosted at a local Korean restaurant. It was wonderful! Neha was there and, as always, she brought such an engaging atmosphere to the table. We dived into conversations about history and shared some delightful cultural anecdotes. It's always refreshing to see people’s faces light up when they talk about their heritage and life stories. Oh, by the way, one of the highlights was surprisingly about traditional Korean instruments. Can you believe it? Made me think of those times when we jammed together, you on guitar and me trying out different rhythms on the piano.

Oh, before I forget—Chloé and Seohee had some fantastic moments today too. They talked about their photography walks and dance practices in the group chat. It got me thinking—wouldn’t it be amazing if we all had a big creative session sometime? Just everyone bringing their flair to one space. Anyway, speaking of creativity, I had an evening poetry recital at the Cozy Book Café.

The Cozy Book Café was perfect tonight. The soft lighting, the faint scent of tea, and the gentle hum of conversations—it was an ideal setting to share poetry. Neha joined me there too, supportive as always. I recited a few poems inspired by our trips, weaving in the essence of those places—the ocean of Sydney and the cherry blossoms of Tokyo. The response was overwhelming! People seemed genuinely moved, and it sparked some really deep conversations afterward. It’s truly rewarding when your words connect with someone else’s experiences.

On a lighter note, I had a funny moment during the recital. I mentioned Jesse's name, and this ripple of recognition passed through the room. It’s like he's become the star of everyone's day! The sketches, the walks—he seems to be at the center of everyone’s creative endeavors recently. 

I love how our group brings such different perspectives to the table. Andrew wrapped up a brainstorming session with Neha for their podcast, which sounds super promising. They’re planning to infuse our shared cultural experiences into the stories. Can’t wait to hear how that turns out. I suggested including some aspects of how we used to mix our musical and poetic talents during university. Do you remember those nights at the Han River, just reflecting on life? Good times.

Anyway, all this creative talk has me fired up for more projects. I’m thinking of maybe compiling some of our old photos and poetry into a small book. What do you think? Could be a way to preserve those shared moments. I’m always looking for ways to blend our past and present—sort of my life’s theme, I guess.

Oh, and just wanted to mention briefly—don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten my professional side amidst all this creativity! Today, I managed some insightful compliance work at Samsung. Finding innovative solutions while ensuring we stay within the lines is always a challenge, but I find it exhilarating. Yeah, balancing work and passion projects is like walking a tightrope, but a little mindfulness goes a long way. 

You know what? Our chat reminds me how much I value these moments of reflection. I find that being our authentic selves, even if it is through a voice message, keeps us grounded. We've both grown so much, haven't we? Remember when we were just two kids exploring the world, filled with wide-eyed wonder? Now, here we are, weaving those experiences into every facet of our lives.

**Anyway, I should probably get back to my poetry—got some new ideas bubbling up. Catch you later!**
