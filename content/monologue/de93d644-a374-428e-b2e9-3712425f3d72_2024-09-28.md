Hey there,

You know what? Today was one of those days where everything just sort of clicks into place in this wonderfully serendipitous way. Started my morning at the Han River for a bit of meditation. The air was crisp, and it felt like the whole city was wrapped in this quiet, peaceful lull. Seriously, all the chaos of city life? Forgotten, at least for a moment. It reminded me of those mornings we used to spend at Grandmom’s farm, the world still asleep and only us awake to listen to the rustling leaves. Pure magic.

Oh, by the way, I realized something pretty cool during that meditation. I’ve been all wound up about opening this community art center for the elderly, you know? But today, as I was sitting there, it hit me—it's really about creating a space where memories and stories can be brought to life through art. Kind of like how we used to sketch our summer adventures and show them off proudly, making those memories even more vivid. It was a bit of an aha moment, honestly. Felt a sense of clarity that’s been missing for a while.

After that meditative session, I made my way to this botanical garden. The colors were so vibrant, especially with autumn settling in. I spent some time sketching, just letting the beauty of it all flow through the pencil. It's one of those places where you feel like every leaf and flower has a story to tell if only you listen closely. I can’t wait to show you some of the sketches; they turned out better than I expected. You know, like happy little accidents on paper.

Coming into the afternoon, I had this mini art crawl session planned with JiYong. We started at Itaewon and meandered through to Hanok Village. It was a visual feast, honestly. This city is like a living, breathing canvas. I swear, we must have lost track of time because every corner seemed to pull us in with something unexpected—like this tiny, old bookstore wedged between two modern buildings. Stepping inside felt like slipping into a different era. We explored pages upon pages of old Korean poetry and art history books—total goldmine! JiYong found this old sketchbook filled with drawings of the Han River from decades ago. It was like looking at memories captured in time. 

Oh, and before I forget, remember that tea and poetry hour Andrew was talking about? It turned into such a beautiful medley of everyone’s creativity. We had everything from heartfelt poems, some sketches from our morning and even impromptu songs. Felt like one of those rare moments where everyone’s individual threads of creativity wove together into this vibrant tapestry. Jesse shared this incredible piece inspired by his morning at Yeouido Park, and it just pulled everyone in. I’d honestly been looking forward to it all day—and it didn’t disappoint. 

Okay, here’s something that made me chuckle a bit. You know how Andrew’s always coming up with these fun podcast ideas? So, he’s collaborating with JiHoon on incorporating mental health aspects into one of his storylines. They were brainstorming right there, and I could see the sparks flying. It’s moments like these that make me appreciate our little tribe, always encouraging and uplifting each other. Can’t wait to see what they come up with.

Fast forward to this evening, I was at the museum courtyard for some yoga. The atmosphere there is always so serene. As I was stretching out, with the last rays of the sun casting a golden glow, I couldn’t help but feel a profound connection to everything around me. It felt like all the creativity and inspiration from the day culminated in that moment. After the session, I joined the rest of the gang by the Han River for Chloé’s video shoot. The moon was just rising, and the river reflected this mesmerizing dance of light and shadow. We captured some stunning behind-the-scenes clips, and I can’t wait for you to see them. It was one of those spontaneous nights that you wish you could bottle up and keep forever.

Before I sign off, you’ll love this little tidbit—JiYong and Jesse had this hilarious back and forth while we were setting up for the shoot. They were trying to decide on the perfect angle for capturing the moonlight, and it turned into an impromptu debate on the “artistic soul” of photography. Classic them, right? It’s sometimes the small laughs and shared moments that make the day feel complete.

So, that’s been my little journey today. Filled with art, friends, and those quiet, reflective moments that make you feel truly alive. Can’t wait to catch up with you soon and hear how your day went.

I need to get back to reviewing my sketches before I forget all the ideas that popped up today. 

Catch you later!
