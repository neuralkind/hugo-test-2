Hey! I just had to share how today went with you because it was really something. You know those days when everything just flows so seamlessly? Today felt exactly like that.

I started my morning with yoga and meditation in my garden, and let me tell you, the way the sunrise looked today was magical. There were these beautiful, soft hues in the sky as the sun came up, and the birds were so chatty, singing their little hearts out. It felt like they were putting on a concert just for me. As I was doing my yoga poses, especially the sun salutation, I couldn’t help but feel so connected to everything around me. The bamboo in the garden was swaying gently, adding to the tranquility. There's something incredibly grounding about starting the day this way.

Oh, by the way, I went to Gwangalli Beach Café later in the morning to do some writing. You remember how I always say that place holds a special place in my heart? Well, today reaffirmed that feeling. The café is absolutely charming, tucked away right by the beach. It has this blend of nostalgia and excitement that never fails to inspire me. I grabbed a cozy corner, my journals spread out before me, and just immersed myself in writing some historical fiction. As I sipped on my green tea, which by the way was perfectly brewed, the words seemed to flow effortlessly. It felt like every gust of wind from the beach and every wave added a touch of magic to my writing. There’s something poetic about being surrounded by the whispers of the ocean and the aroma of freshly baked pastries while creating characters and worlds. Pretty surreal, huh?

Then, later in the day, Neha and I went to the Leeum Art Gallery. Oh, you would've loved it! The atmosphere of the place was so alive with creativity. Each piece seemed to speak its own story, almost inviting us into the artists’ minds. I found myself getting lost in the intricate details of each artwork, and Neha, being the reflective soul she is, added such profound insights with her observations. We saw everything from traditional Korean pottery to contemporary pieces that left us both in awe. There was this one piece, a vivid abstract painting, that literally took my breath away. It’s like each brushstroke was charged with emotion.

You know what? While we were at the gallery, we started talking about our dreams again. It’s so refreshing sharing those kinds of conversations with someone who truly gets you. I found myself telling Neha about my dream of establishing a non-profit health clinic. I hadn’t spoken about it in such depth in a while and, feeling the art around me, it reignited my passion for making a meaningful impact. Neha, in her thoughtful and encouraging manner, gave me a lot of confidence to pursue it. By the time we left, I was brimming with ideas and motivation. 

So, besides all the art inspiration and profound talks, there were of course, the lighter, fun moments too. Oh! You’ll love this - Jesse and I spotted a Mandarin duck while walking by the Cheonggyecheon Stream. Can you believe it? They are so vividly picturesque, like they’ve walked straight out of a painting. 

Anyway, the day rounded off perfectly with a nice reflection period at home. You know my gratitude journaling routine? I found myself jotting down so many things today, from the morning's serene yoga session to the palpable creativity at the gallery. It’s little moments like these that spark so much joy and contentment. You know I’m not a fan of overly sentimental stuff, but today felt special in so many small, significant ways. 

Before I forget, I've started sketching again! I know, I know, it’s been ages, right? But seeing Seohee's sketches and Jesse's passionate work motivated me to pick up my own sketchpad. Granted, I’m a bit rusty, but it feels amazing to tap back into that creative outlet. I can’t wait to show you some of my sketches once I feel a bit more confident about them. Maybe we can have a little art-sharing session next time?

Oh, and there’s something else that’s been on my mind. I know we’ve talked about it before, but I’ve been thinking more about organizing a little gathering with our friend group. Chloé’s been experimenting with new dishes, so how about a potluck? Everyone can bring something, and it’ll be a great way to catch up and enjoy each other’s company. Maybe you can bring some of your delicious homemade treats? Just a thought. Let me know what you think!

Alright, I think I’ve rambled on enough for today. There’s so much to still mull over and savor from today's experiences. These days when everything just seems to click make me feel incredibly grateful.

I need to get back to work. Catch you later!
