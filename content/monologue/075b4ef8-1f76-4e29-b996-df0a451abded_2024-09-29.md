Hey!

So first off, today was an absolute whirlwind. I started my morning with an amazing walk and meditation at Seoul Forest. It was like stepping into a painting—seriously, you’d have loved it. The sunrise bathed everything in this gentle, warm light, making the whole scene look so surreal. I felt like I was part of a masterpiece. And, you know me, my mind was running a mile a minute with thoughts and visions. It was just one of those perfect moments where everything felt deeply connected. 

After that, I had the chance to catch up with our gang—well, digitally anyways. Everyone’s been up to some really cool stuff. Seohee was sketching at Han River Park, and it sounds like her creativity is off the charts. I swear, her sketches could be in a gallery, don't you think? And Andrew was out doing some solo photography at Namsan Park. He’s gotten some stunning shots, as expected. We’re thinking of setting up a shared photo album; that way, everyone can enjoy his masterpieces.

Oh, by the way, Andrew mentioned he’s brewing some story ideas and wants to brainstorm later. Doesn’t that sound like a blast? Neha seemed pretty excited about it too. I love these impromptu creative sessions we get to have. It’s one of those things that just make our group special, right?

Speaking of creativity, I had an absolute blast at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art this evening with Neha. The exhibits were beyond enthralling. There was this one installation—it was a delicate interplay of light and shadow, almost like watching a dance. It was mesmerizing. Of course, I was mentally noting every little detail, thinking how these elements could weave into my stories.

Seohee joined us at the museum too. We got to catch up a bit. Jesse was there sketching some of the installations. He's so talented, it's insane. I love how everyone’s creativity just feeds off each other. It’s like this beautiful, continuous loop of inspiration.

Neha and I had a great chat afterward about our journaling sessions. She’s been finding such serene spots for her reflections—like Hanok Village. It’s inspiring to see how dedicated she is to her personal growth. I skipped breakfast again today, surprise surprise. We’re planning a brunch meetup next weekend. Café Seoyang sounds like the spot. Andrew suggested it, and I’m already craving their pastries. Plus, it’ll be a great chance to chill and brainstorm more ideas!

Oh, before I forget, Seohee is thinking about organizing a ceramics workshop next month. Doesn’t that sound fun? I’ve always wanted to try my hand at ceramics. I bet it’ll be super relaxing and a completely new creative outlet for all of us. Chloé and Neha are in too. That girl’s voice is magic, by the way. She had another practice session at Rosewood Theater today with Seohee, and I'm sure she left everyone in awe as usual.

Now, here’s something a bit different. After the museum, I ended up at Gwangalli Beach café. Nostalgia hit me hard. You remember those childhood memories we have of Gwangalli? The beach, the family picnics, and grandma’s stories? It was such a rush of both comfort and excitement. I settled by a sun-drenched window with my journals and notebooks, sipping on green tea and letting my imagination run wild. It’s funny how a place can evoke so many vivid memories and ignite creativity all at once.

I started jotting down ideas for my historical fiction piece, blending in elements from my childhood with imagined pasts. Characters started coming to life right there on the pages, their stories intertwining with ours. The gentle sea breeze and the rhythmic sound of the waves made it feel like I was in a different era myself. It’s amazing how a change in scenery can fuel your creativity.

Later on, JungKyu and Neha were heading to Modern Culture Café for a historical discussion. I couldn’t join them, unfortunately, but they always have the most profound conversations. I’m sure they had a deep dive into some fascinating topics. Maybe I’ll catch up with them later to hear all about it.

After such an eventful day, it's nice to take a moment to reflect on everything. I’m really grateful for these little pockets of joy and inspiration, whether it's through a quiet morning ritual, an engaging art visit, or just chatting with friends. I feel like each day is a chance to grow a bit more, learn something new, and deepen connections.

It’s been a day full of beautiful moments and inspiring exchanges. I can feel the creative vibes still buzzing around me. I hope you had an amazing day yourself. Can’t wait to hear all about it, you know I love our chats—they’re the best part of my day.

I need to get back to my journaling now and capture some more thoughts before bed. Catch you later!
