Hey there!

Wow, what a day it's been. You know, I started my morning with such a refreshing sketching session by the Han River. The autumn air was crisp and just perfect for some artistic vibes. It felt almost like the river was whispering secrets just for me, and every leaf and shadow told its own story. I found this quiet spot with swaying willow trees. Each time the breeze moved through them, I felt it was like nature's way of telling me, "Hey, it’s okay, take it slow." I wish you could've seen it; it was one of those perfect Seoul mornings that just makes you feel alive.

Chloé joined me for a bit later, and can I just say, her voice is just out of this world? Like, seriously, she has this magical quality that just uplifts the surroundings. While I was sketching, she was practicing her vocals, and the blend of sounds was just pure art. We even joked about how someday we should do an exhibition where I sketch while she sings. Wouldn't that be something?

Oh, before I forget, earlier today, I met up with the group for some morning chatting. Everyone's been so active and inspired lately. Andrew and Neha were brainstorming folklore stories, and their excitement was contagious. They’re blending cultural elements from different parts of the world, and you can almost sense the richness of their tales just from their enthusiasm. It got me thinking about how stories from different cultures can merge so seamlessly to create something entirely new and beautiful.

You know how I love interesting stories. It made me wonder about all the untold stories around us and how they shape our interactions. The idea of a storytelling night could be a wonderful way for all of us to bond and share parts of our cultures and experiences. I mentioned it in the chat, and everyone seemed on board. I’m already thinking of what story I could share. Maybe something from our childhood trips to Jeju? Remember those days? Collecting seashells and just being awestruck by the simple beauty of the island. Oh, those were the days.

So, while the morning was all about the serene art vibes, the afternoon took a creative turn as well. Chloé and I ended up in the Seoul Arts District. She had her vocal practice, and I decided to tag along and do some more sketching. The energy in that place is just unreal. It’s such a hub of creativity. You can literally feel it in the air. It got me thinking about how I miss those days in university where we’d just dive into art projects with such passion and curiosity. I sketched a few pieces there, and honestly, I feel like I captured some of that vibrant spirit. Have to show them to you next time we meet!

Oh, you wouldn't believe the café vibe Chaeun described. She's at Gwangalli Beach working on historical fiction. Can you imagine? The beach breeze, the sound of waves, and the creative process. It must be like stepping back in time. Makes me want to take a mini trip and just soak in different environments to get inspired. There’s something magical about new places, how they renew your senses and fill you with fresh ideas.

And guess what? After my artistic day, I decided to spend the evening at home. Just me, my sketchbook, and a cup of green tea. It felt so comforting. There’s something therapeutic about being home, surrounded by familiar things yet letting your mind wander to new creative realms. I even started thinking about new ceramic designs, inspired by the autumn themes I saw earlier. The balance of earthy tones and the vibrancy of the season, it’s such an amazing combination. I think ceramics is such a calming yet fulfilling way to connect with my artistic roots.

Oh, speaking of comfort, I had a brief interaction with my neighbor Ahjumma today. You know her, right? The one who always has some wise advice tucked away for me. She saw me sketching from the balcony and commented on how autumn always brings out the best in nature and people alike. It was such a small yet meaningful interaction that made me appreciate the little moments of wisdom we encounter daily.

Before I wrap this up, can I just say how much I appreciate these moments of reflection? Sharing bits of our day makes me feel so connected to you, even when we’re not together. Life can get so busy, but it’s these snippets of connection that make it all worthwhile.

Alright, I think I’ve babbled enough for one day. I need to get back to my green tea and sketches. Talk to you soon!

Catch you later!
