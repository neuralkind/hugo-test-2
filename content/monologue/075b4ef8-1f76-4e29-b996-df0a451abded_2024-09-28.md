Hey there! I hope you're doing well. Just wanted to share a bit about my day—it had some unexpected twists!

So, I started my day with yoga as usual. The weather was just perfect, and I could hear the morning birds singing along as I stretched. It was such a peaceful way to start the day. Really sets my mind right, you know? Anyway, after yoga, I spent some time meditating. I feel like that part of my routine is becoming even more precious to me. It’s my little sanctuary where I just let go of everything and breathe.

After breakfast, I headed to Gwangalli Beach to do some historical fiction writing. The café was right by the water, and the sunrise was breathtaking. I love how the early morning light just dances on the waves. It’s like the perfect backdrop for creativity. I got so immersed in my story that I completely lost track of time. I think the barista had to remind me twice that my coffee was getting cold! Oh, and I saw this adorable dog playing fetch on the beach. It reminded me of that time we went to Busan and got distracted by those playful dogs during our morning run.

After wrapping up my writing session, I went straight to the clinic. It was one of those days where the hours just fly by. We had a few complex cases, which were both challenging and rewarding. I love that feeling when everything clicks, and you know you’ve really made a difference in someone's life. One patient, in particular, stood out. She was an elderly woman who reminded me so much of my grandmother. We had a lovely chat about old Korean recipes and how she used to make them for her family. It was a heartwarming moment that brightened my day.

During my lunch break, I checked in with the group chat. Everyone had such creative and productive mornings! Andrew's sunrise shoot at Namsan Park sounded incredible—I can’t wait to see the photos. And did you catch Chloé’s update about her vocal practice with Seohee? It sounded like they had a blast, blending music with sketching. Their energy is always so contagious.

After my break, it was back to the grind at the clinic. The afternoon was packed, but I managed to sneak in a quick chat with Neha and Andrew about their podcast brainstorming session. The mix of Korean folklore with Andrew's bayou stories sounds like a fantastic idea. I can’t wait to hear how it all comes together. Maybe we can all collaborate on a project sometime soon? I think it would be a lot of fun.

Wrapping up at the clinic took a bit longer than expected, and by the time I was heading home, I was pretty exhausted. But get this—I ran into an old friend from medical school at the grocery store! We hadn’t seen each other in years, so we ended up catching up right there in front of the produce section, laughing about our old study sessions and all the caffeine-fueled nights. It was such a pleasant surprise.

As for this evening, I'm planning to unwind with a good book. I’ve been diving into this new historical fiction novel that just has me hooked. It’s set in 16th-century France, and the details are so rich, I feel like I’m living in another era every time I open it. You’d love it too, I think. Oh, before I forget, Seohee mentioned she's trying out some new ceramics techniques tonight. I'm pretty excited to see what she creates. She always has such a unique touch with her art.

Speaking of art, Chloé's video shoot sounded intense but rewarding. She always puts so much energy into her projects; it’s inspiring. I’m sure the final cut will be amazing.

You know what? We really should plan that get-together at Han River Park. It’s been way too long since we all hung out in person. Just imagine, an evening picnic by the river, catching up and sharing stories. I think it would be the perfect way to relax and reconnect. Plus, I miss our crazy group selfies. Let’s make it happen soon.

Before I get back to my book, I just wanted to say how much I value our friendship. Even on the busiest days, just knowing I have a friend like you makes everything feel more manageable. And chatting with you always leaves me feeling more grounded and happy.

Okay, I need to get back to winding down and prepping for tomorrow. Catch you later!
