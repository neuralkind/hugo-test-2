Hey there!

Wow, what a day it has been! I started off my morning with a sunrise run at Namsan Park. Just imagine the sky slowly lighting up and the city coming to life. There’s something almost magical about it. It was like the entire world was waking up with me—that crisp morning air, birds softly singing, and just the soft hum of city life waking up. An incredibly grounding way to start the day. I even took a few moments afterward to jot down some thoughts in my journal. Felt super refreshing!

After the run, I met up with Jesse for our vocal practice session at the Rosewood Theater. Seohee came along too, sketchpad in hand, of course. It was such a vibrant scene! Jesse brought his sketchbook too, and he was drawing while I practiced. Seohee’s sketches are always so alive with energy. It's fascinating how she captures the flow and movement in her drawings. At one point, she made this hilarious observation about my singing posture that had us all laughing. Honestly, it was such a perfect morning filled with creativity and camaraderie.

Oh, and you know what’s funny? As I was belting out some high notes, Jesse suddenly got inspired and pulled off this impromptu sketch of me mid-song. We were all in stitches because he added this fairy-like background with musical notes floating around. He called it a "Chloé in her natural habitat" portrait. It was such a great laugh.

Then, oh before I forget, I made a quick detour to this delightful little café with JiYong. We’ve been planning this vintage cinema exploration for a while now. Talk about stepping back in time! It felt like we were transported to a different era, with those old noir films lighting up the screen and the soft murmuring of a bygone audience filling the room. There’s something so nostalgic and classy about those films—they really knew how to capture emotion without all the flashy effects we have now.

Later in the evening, I attended this amazing art exhibition at the Seoul Arts District. It was a blend of Korean tradition with avant-garde French artistry—very much like my own background. Walking around, I couldn’t help but feel inspired. The gallery was just filled with this electric energy, each art piece telling its own unique story. I chatted with a few artists who had such incredible insights. There was one piece called "Harmony in Diversity" that really struck a chord with me. Imagine clashing colors blending together to form this beautiful, unified image. It got me thinking about how our differences can actually create something truly beautiful when we embrace them.

Honestly, I could feel the creative juices flowing just being in that space. I even took a few photos hoping I could capture some of this magic and perhaps get some inspiration for my next song. It's moments like these that make me appreciate how art transcends language and culture, resonating at a much deeper level.

And get this! On my way out, I bumped into a local artist who remembered me from a previous event. We had this impromptu mini-collaboration idea for a future project, which left me absolutely buzzing with excitement. I love those serendipitous moments where paths just cross and new opportunities arise out of the blue. Keeps things so wonderfully unpredictable.

To wrap up the day, I tried out a little culinary experiment in my kitchen. Inspired by today’s multicultural vibes, I decided to fuse some French and Korean flavors. Ended up making a kimchi quiche, believe it or not! It was surprisingly delicious, even though my kitchen now looks like a small tornado swept through it. But the balance of spicy and savory was totally worth it. You should come over sometime—I'd love for us to cook together. 

By the way, before I forget, I'm thinking of checking out that Leeum Museum multimedia exhibit that everyone’s been raving about. Haelim and JiHoon said it was mind-blowing. We should definitely plan a visit soon. Imagine the kind of inspiration we could soak up together!

Anyway, that’s enough rambling from me. How was your day? Did you get up to anything exciting? I miss our spontaneous little adventures! Catch up soon?

I need to get back to work. Catch you later!
