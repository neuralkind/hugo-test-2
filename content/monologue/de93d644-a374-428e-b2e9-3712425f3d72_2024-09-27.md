Hey, you!

So, today was quite an adventure! I started off my morning with this serene art meditation by the Han River. You know how much I love those quiet moments by the water. The autumn colors were just breathtaking. I found this perfect spot under a golden tree, and the way the leaves shimmered against the sky—it felt like being in one of those dreamy paintings from our art history classes! The crisp air was a gentle reminder of how seasons change and renew everything, which I found really inspiring.

After that, oh, you won’t believe who I bumped into at the cafe. JiYong! We had such a lively chat about his new project—turning his workshop into a cozy beachside café. And guess what? He’s incorporating storytelling sessions into the café! Isn’t that just brilliant? We brainstormed some ideas, and it got me thinking about how wonderful it would be to have our own little storytelling corners in our future community art center.

Oh, by the way, during our group chat, JiHoon and I decided to grab coffee later. We both needed a break after our session at the Seoul Senior Center. Speaking of which, the art showcase with the seniors was absolutely heartwarming. There were these moments where the seniors’ faces just lit up as they painted. There was one gentleman, Mr. Kim, who narrated his youthful days through each brushstroke, and it felt like the colors were dancing to his memories. And then, lovely JiHoon with his boundless energy—he was such a hit! You should have seen him bouncing around, sharing stories, and making everyone laugh. Their joy was so infectious.

I also had this lovely catch-up with Andrew and Chloé. Andrew’s photos from Yeouido Park were stunning. The fog made everything look so ethereal. And Chloé, oh, she’s been diving deep into her vocal practices. I promised her I’d join one of her sessions soon. I could use her musical vibes to jazz up my days a bit. Plus, she mentioned she'll be bringing her sketchbook, and you know how I can’t resist some spontaneous art!

Before I forget, Jesse’s been on fire with his sketches lately. He shared some of his latest work, and it’s incredible how he just captures the essence of everything. I mentioned we should all go for a group visit to that multimedia exhibit at the Leeum Museum. It’s so immersive; I’m pretty sure Jesse will get loads of inspiration from it, and we’ll have an art-overload day, which sounds like heaven, doesn’t it?

And remember I told you about my European adventures? I’ve been thinking a lot about them today. It’s funny how these peaceful moments here in Seoul can remind me of those times in Madrid or Paris. Though I miss the croissants and the late-night art strolls, being here and planning our elderly art center feels so right. It’s like every experience has led me to this very moment, you know?

Oh, and just a little update—I've been working on a new painting, something inspired by the cherry blossoms in Gyeongju and the vibrant streets of Madrid. It’s kind of a blend—a burst of past memories and current dreams. I think you’ll love it when you see it. I’ve been putting my heart into it, channeling all these reflections and the joy from today. It’s these little moments—like seeing the seniors smile and chatting with friends—that fuel my creativity.

Before I drift into another art ramble, I should mention that I met a sweet little cat near the center. It kept following me for a bit. I’ve named it “Sketch” because of its curious nature and the way it seemed to be studying everything around. Made me wonder if it was an artist in its past life! 

You know what? Today just reaffirmed how special our little circle is. We’re all so artistically charged and connected. It’s like each one of us is a color in this beautiful painting of friendship. I feel so grateful for that. 

Also, I realized how much I miss our deep talks in person. We need to plan something soon, maybe another one of our café hopping adventures? I could use some of those deep conversations and laughter with you. And Seoul has so many new spots we must explore. Autumn is just the perfect backdrop for our little escapades.

I have to head back now, the seniors are waiting for their final touches to be reviewed. Catch you later!

Bye!
