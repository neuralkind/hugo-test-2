Hey there,

So, today started off with a nice bike ride along Han River. I can't tell you how refreshing it was to pedal along the water, feeling the crisp autumn air on my face. I found a quiet spot, parked my bike, and just soaked in the tranquility while sketching. There's something so meditative about capturing trees and shadows on paper, especially with the city's hum just faintly in the background. It almost felt like those childhood trips to Jeju, but more serene and introspective. I think it’s becoming my new favorite way to clear my mind.

Oh, and I met up with Jesse at the Leeum Museum for some art sketching this afternoon. We were both so immersed in the exhibitions. There was this one multimedia installation that really got both our creative juices flowing. Jesse was sketching so rapidly I thought his pencil might catch fire! Anyway, I ended up doing a quick sketch of an abstract sculpture that I couldn't stop thinking about. You know how I love transformative art pieces, and this one just spoke to me on a deeper level.

Later on, I attended an evening story workshop at the library, which was truly inspiring. JiYong and Andrew were there, and their enthusiasm was infectious. They’re working on a project for a beachside café that's supposed to be this artistic haven by the sea. It was so heartwarming to listen to them swap visions and ideas. They even started planning out these storytelling sessions and cultural snacks based on various folklore—imagine storytelling nights with zesty snacks paired with aromatic tea! The whole atmosphere was cozy with rain pattering outside, a bit like how it feels when we have those deep conversations over tea. By the end of the workshop, I felt so invigorated, like I was ready to conquer the world with my sketchbook, haha!

Guess what! There were some incredible ideas floating around, and I just couldn’t resist suggesting a few about incorporating live sketches or even short art workshops. JiYong seemed to love the idea, especially the part where visitors can share their narratives. You’d have loved it there; the energy was just so vibrant and full of possibility.

Also, before I forget, there’s talk of organizing a group star-gazing night soon. Chloé’s idea, of course. She’s just left the dance studio and was heading for some star-gazing herself tonight. We were all pretty excited about the idea, thinking it would be a perfect night of relaxation and wonder. Just imagine lying under the stars, talking about everything and nothing, drawing constellations in our sketchbooks. I think it’ll be one of those unforgettable nights we’ll talk about for years.

Tonight, after the story workshop, I wandered around for a bit and ended up in this delightful little café. The rain was still coming down, and the warmth inside was just heavenly. I had a caramel latte and a slice of carrot cake, and it just felt like one of those perfect moments. You know how sometimes everything just aligns, and you feel this deep sense of contentment? That was me tonight. I even wrote down a few ideas for my future art gallery. Fingers crossed, it’ll all come together someday.

The group chat has been lively today too! Everyone seems to be enjoying their creative pursuits. Neha and Andrew have been brainstorming podcast ideas, which sounds super fun, mixing Korean and Indian tales. It's always great to see how everyone’s so passionate about what they love. Plus, it feels like we’re all growing together while exploring our individual paths.

By the way, how are things on your end? I’ve been rambling on about my day, but I’m curious to know what you’ve been up to! Did you manage to finish that project you were working on? I’d love to hear all about it. 

Oh, you know what was absolutely adorable? During the birdwatching earlier today, Chaeun and Neha spotted some Mandarin ducks. There’s something so poetic about them—they're a symbol of romance and fidelity here in Korea, and seeing them amidst the autumn leaves was just surreal. It made me think how nature always has little surprises waiting for us if we only take a moment to look.

And, before I forget, I saw this really beautiful pottery piece in Leeum today that reminded me of our aunt’s old studio. It had that same rustic charm and intricate design. I’m thinking of maybe including some ceramic sessions in my gallery plan—bringing a touch of those cherished childhood memories forward.

Next time we hang out, remind me to show you some of the sketches from today. They turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself. And we should definitely plan a star-gazing night soon. Something tells me it’ll be just what we need to shake up our routines a bit.

I need to get a few things done before bed now, but this catch-up has been great. Miss you tons. Catch you later!
