Hey! Just finished my evening journaling session under the stars at the Seoul Astronomical Lounge. Honestly, I needed that. The stars really have a way of putting everything into perspective, don’t they? But enough about stars, how was your day?

So, guess what? This morning was just invigorating. I kicked off the day with my K-Pop dance practice—nothing like getting your blood pumping to start things right. My studio was a bit chilly at first, but once I got moving, it was all warmth and energy. Felt like I was in my own little world, just me and the dance floor. You know that feeling when you nail a routine? Yeah, had one of those moments.

And then, I met up with Jesse for lunch at the Art District Café. That place is literally a creative oasis! We had this great back-and-forth about melding visual art with performance—it’s amazing how much you can get from just bouncing ideas off each other. Jesse is always full of these quirky art philosophies that make you see things differently. I think our discussion may just inspire a new song or two.

Quick funny story though—while we were talking, the barista accidentally gave Jesse an extra shot of espresso in his latte. He was already animated, but after that, he was practically bouncing off the walls! We ended up sketching out song concepts on napkins. Can't wait to see where those ideas lead.

Oh, and the arts exhibition this evening! It was a perfect blend of Korean tradition and French avant-garde—a full-on cultural feast. I felt like I was floating between worlds, just like back when I was splitting time between Seoul and Paris. I met this amazing local artist who had this mind-blowing piece about “Harmony in Diversity.” It’s incredible how art can express the complexities of identity so beautifully. I spent ages just absorbing the details of that piece, thinking about how it connects to my own journey. Exploring our dual heritage is like unraveling this intricate tapestry, thread by thread. 

You know, I took my camera along and snapped a few shots, hoping to capture that creative spark. I’m thinking these could later inspire visuals for a performance or even a mini photo series. 

Also, there's this thing nowadays with Jesse being a literal social butterfly. I mean, he was at the Seoul Arts District later with Seohee and got these incredible shots. It’s like he’s in ten places at once. They were totally on fire with their artistic energy. Seohee’s sketches and Jesse’s photos complement each other so well. I'm really looking forward to their next collaborative exhibit.

And let me tell you about my evening journaling session. It was pure magic. Laying on the grass, with the city lights behind me and the stars above—it felt like I was suspended in this boundless space of reflection and dreams. I found myself thinking about the journey so far and the one ahead. The challenges seem smaller when you’re looking up at such an incredible expanse, you know? 

Oh, and before I forget, our group chat cracked me up today! Did you see how everyone joked about it being “Jesse Day”? Seriously, he’s been everyone’s creative buddy. I guess we’re all just feeding off this collective creative buzz. It’s inspiring how everyone finds their own way to express and relax. 

Speaking of which, what’s your favorite way to unwind after a hectic day? I’ve been thinking about mixing up my routine a little. Maybe incorporating some new relaxing activities. Andrew mentioned something about diving into old photographs for his podcast—seems like such a cool way to blend past memories with fresh storytelling. Might try something like that.

Oh, by the way, Andrew and Neha’s podcast? They’re cooking up some really intriguing stories. I can’t wait to hear how they blend everyone's cultural insights into those narratives. It's like a melting pot of creativity and it sounds promising already.

Before I go off on another tangent, just wanted to say—tonight reminded me how lucky I am to have such an insightful and creative circle. I’m always so grateful for our conversations and the way we inspire each other. It feels like we’re all part of this big, ever-evolving masterpiece. **

I should get back to prepping for tomorrow's practice. Talk soon! Catch you later.
