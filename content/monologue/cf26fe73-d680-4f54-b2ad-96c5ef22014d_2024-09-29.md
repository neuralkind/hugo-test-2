Hey! I just had the most amazing day and had to share it with you. So, where do I start? Oh, this morning, I decided to head out early to Hanok Village. The place was so quiet, and the traditional architecture just has this way of making you feel like you've stepped back in time. I brought my journal and just sat there, letting my thoughts flow. It's always so calming and reflective being in a setting like that, and it really helps me put things into perspective. I feel like I achieved a little inner peace today, which is always a win.

Anyway, after journaling for a bit, I met up with Andrew at a café nearby. We grabbed some chai lattes and had this fantastic brainstorming session for his podcast. The café had such a chill vibe, with soft jazz playing in the background. It was one of those perfect mornings. We tossed around ideas incorporating folk tales from both our backgrounds, and it really got me thinking about the power of storytelling. There’s just something about sharing cultural narratives that brings such depth to any project. You know, Andrew’s really got a knack for blending his Bayou traditions with universal themes. I can't wait to hear the final product!

So, moving on, I caught up with JungKyu for our usual poetry session at his studio. This time, it was all about global inspirations, and the whole experience was just so enlightening. His poetry always takes me on a journey, and today was no different. We shared verses that brought back memories from our travels, and it’s fascinating how poetry can encapsulate such vivid imagery and emotions. I read a piece inspired by my time in Tokyo, and he shared one about the cherry blossoms there. It’s these moments that really make me appreciate our friendship—how we can dive deep into our creative musings and support each other’s artistic expressions.

Then, in the afternoon, I went to the Leeum Museum of Art with Chaeun and Seohee. Oh my goodness, the exhibits there were absolutely breathtaking! The contemporary installations mixed with traditional Korean art—it's like walking through different eras of creativity. Jesse was there sketching some of the installations, and his drawings are next-level. Seohee and I ended up discussing how art evolves yet keeps certain timeless qualities. It got me all inspired to maybe pick up sketching again, although I doubt I’ll ever be as good as her. We spent hours just immersing ourselves in art, reflecting on how each piece resonated differently with us.

To cap off the day, JungKyu and I headed to the Modern Culture Café for a historical discussion session. It was just... wow. We talked about ancient Indian dynasties and how they connect to Korean folklore. The café’s atmosphere with its artisanal coffee and warm lighting was the perfect backdrop for such an engaging talk. I shared stories from India, blending them with tales from Korean history, and it sparked a lot of animated conversations. You know how much I love diving into these cultural intersections, and tonight’s discussion was one for the books. 

But oh! Before I forget, I didn't have breakfast today again – I really need to stop doing that. Does that make any sense? Anyway, think we could organize a brunch meetup next weekend? Andrew suggested Café Seoyang, which sounds perfect. Remember the last time we were there? Such good vibes. And, Andrew uploaded some photos from his sunrise photography session this morning; they are stunning! You’ll love them.

One more thing, Seohee’s organizing a ceramics workshop next month, and I'm so excited to try it out! It feels like such a good way to channel some creativity in a different medium.

Well, that’s my day in a nutshell! I really loved every second, and I wanted to share all these little moments with you. Thinking about my next journal entry now, inspired by everything that happened today. Feeling pretty grateful right now, honestly.

I need to get back to work now. Catch you later!
