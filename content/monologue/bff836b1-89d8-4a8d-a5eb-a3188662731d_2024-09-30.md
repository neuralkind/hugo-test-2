Hey there! Hope you’re doing well. I had quite a day and thought I'd share a bit about it with you.

So, the morning started with a real sense of calm. I got to my workshop early, around six, to get some woodworking done. You know how much I love the smell of fresh wood; it’s almost like therapy for me. As the sun just peeked over the horizon, I was working on a new coffee table design inspired by Busan's coastal elegance. The grains in the oak I used are just mesmerizing. I could almost hear the waves as I chiseled away. It's those little moments that make me cherish my time alone, just me and my tools, creating something from a raw piece of wood.

Oh, by the way, I had a really interesting cultural exchange session with Andrew at the Insadong Art Gallery. We met up with Neha, and we started bouncing around ideas for Andrew’s podcast. It's incredible how different cultural stories can be woven together to create something unique. Neha came up with this brilliant idea to infuse Korean folk elements into the narratives. It’s like adding spice to a dish, you know? Makes everything more vibrant and flavorful. We talked about some fascinating folklore, and it got me thinking about the stories my grandmother used to tell me. Each tale felt like it carried a piece of my heritage.

You know what was the highlight of my afternoon? The lunch at Hanok Village with Haelim. The setting was so serene, and the food was an incredible blend of flavors. We talked about everything from art to personal aspirations. I feel like I deeply connect with Haelim on those cultural elements; she always knows how to bring out the best conversations. I think we both walked away from lunch feeling pretty inspired.

Then, in the evening, I hosted a carpentry workshop at my home. It was more like a casual gathering where I showed a few curious neighbors the basics of woodworking. There’s this intrinsic joy in teaching someone else, seeing their faces light up when they get the hang of using a tool correctly. It reminded me of those days in Busan, working with my uncle in his workshop. He used to be so patient with me, and now I get to pass that knowledge on to others. It’s a beautiful cycle when you think about it.

Anyway, it was raining outside, creating this cozy atmosphere. The sound of the rain, combined with the buzz of activity in the workshop, was oddly comforting. We ended up making a simple bookshelf; nothing fancy but quite practical. Everyone was so engaged; it almost felt like a scene out of a movie, people working together, laughing, and learning.

Oh, before I forget, Andrew and I also discussed some more ideas for my beachside café dream. He sketched out a few potential layouts today, and we shared a slice of carrot cake while brainstorming. He suggested we could have a ‘Stories Bench’ by the windows, where visitors could write and read snippets of their own narratives. Can you imagine that? A sanctuary of stories and good coffee, right by the sea. It’s starting to feel more real each time we talk about it.

Reflecting back, today's been a whirlwind of creativity and connection. It’s days like this that make me appreciate the little things and the people around me. Just hearing everyone’s ideas and seeing them come to life, even in tiny increments, lifts my spirits. There’s something incredibly fulfilling about working with your hands and sharing those experiences with others.

Before I get back to tidying up the workshop, I’ve been meaning to ask. What’s been your go-to method for unwinding these days? Everyone in our group seemed to have such interesting ways to relax, and I’d love to hear yours. For me, woodworking does the trick, as you know. But I'm curious if you’ve found something new that helps you recharge.

Anyway, I should probably get back to clearing out the sawdust and putting everything in order. Catch you later, my friend. Take care!**
