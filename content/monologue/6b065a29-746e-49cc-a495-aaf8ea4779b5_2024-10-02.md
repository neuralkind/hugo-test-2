Hey there,

So, you know how I'm always trying to find those serene, Instagram-worthy spots in Seoul? Well, this morning I ventured out on what turned out to be an incredible solo photo walk around Bukchon Hanok Village. The weather was absolutely perfect—cool breeze, and the smell of autumn in the air. I swear, if I could bottle up this morning's vibe, I would.

The village was bathed in this golden light that made everything look straight out of a fairy tale. Picture this: the traditional Hanok rooftops casting shadows that played tag with the sunlight, and those Gingko trees? They were showing off in their full autumn glory—half gold, half green. I got some shots that are definitely going up on the wall. You know, the kind that tells stories just by looking at them? It felt like I was weaving through history with each click.

Then, because I can't seem to sit still, I headed over to the Seoul Senior Center for an art therapy session Haelim invited me to. Man, the energy there was something else. The room was buzzing with this creative spirit. Haelim started the session with this beautiful reminiscence about cherry blossoms, and you could see everyone just light up. It was like watching flowers bloom right in front of you, but with paintbrushes instead of petals.

JungKyu, with his poet's soul, recited some verses that transported us straight to the tranquility of the Han River. It was almost magical. You'd have loved it, seeing the way the seniors' faces transformed with each line and brushstroke. There was this one elderly lady who painted a scene from her childhood—so full of life and color. It was a reminder of how art can be such a powerful medium for storytelling and healing. Trust me, their laughter and stories were like music to the ears. Felt really good to see everyone connecting and creating something beautiful together.

Oh, by the way, I can't forget to mention this little culinary experiment I had planned for the evening. I was still riding high on the creativity wave, so I decided to dive into some kitchen magic right after gathering some ancient medicinal herbs at the Korean Herb Garden earlier in Gangwon. Let me tell you, that place is a treasure trove of healing wonders. The aroma alone can make you feel like you’ve been whisked away to another era.

I dabbled with various herbs and created this dish that could rival an elixir—ginseng-infused rice cakes paired with stewed ginger cloves. Sounds fancy, right? The flavors were a delightful dance of spicy and sweet. I kept imagining these ingredients have seen so much history and now they're part of this modern culinary tale. Haelim was there too—she was sketching some of the plants while I cooked. Her art always adds a special touch to my culinary experiments. It's like turning a meal into a story, you know?

Before I forget, later in the evening we gathered at Namsan Tower for some sketching. You'd think after all that, I'd be out of creative juice, but nope! The view from Namsan never disappoints. We found this cozy spot and started sketching the city skyline. The lights began to twinkle one by one, and it felt like we were capturing the heartbeat of Seoul in real-time.

Andrew showed up with his camera, and Jesse joined us after his museum visit, looking all inspired. We ended up sharing our sketches and photos over some street food we grabbed on the way. It was one of those moments where you just feel so connected with everything and everyone around you. Chloe and JiYong also popped in later—talk about a full squad! We all traded stories of the day, and it was the perfect blend of laughter, art, and bonding.

Man, today was packed but in the best possible way. From quiet morning meditations to vibrant art sessions, and ending with culinary adventures and cityscapes, it felt like living multiple lifetimes in one day. It makes you appreciate the small magic in everyday moments, doesn’t it?

Anyway, you know how time flies when you’re having a blast. Just wanted to share these bits of my day with you. Hope yours was just as fulfilling.

I need to get back to my sketches now. Catch you later!
