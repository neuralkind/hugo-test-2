Hey there! 

Guess what? Today turned out to be one of those unexpectedly fulfilling days. I started my morning with a meditation session by the Han River. The sun was just starting to paint the sky in those soft, warm hues—you know how calming that can be with the water gently lapping nearby. It always gives me such a peaceful start, and I could almost hear the whisper of old poetry in the breeze. 

After the meditation, I came back home and got immersed in this incredible piano improvisation session. I mean, it felt like the keys had tales hidden in them, waiting to be discovered. I ended up creating some melodies that brought back vivid memories of Sydney and Shanghai. There’s something magical about how music can transport you to different places and times, don’t you think? I could almost smell the salty air of Sydney's beaches and hear the bustling streets of Shanghai through the notes. Two hours just flew by in a heartbeat! 

Then, I had this poetry session with Neha at my home studio. Oh man, it was invigorating! We dived into verses inspired by our travels—from the cherry blossoms in Tokyo to the oceanic vistas in Sydney. Neha shared some of her experiences from Hanok Village earlier in the day, and it blended so well with the ambiance we were creating. There’s just something about poetry that captures the essence of our adventures in a way that photos or conversations can’t quite match, right? It’s like distilling the spirit of a place into words. Andrew even mentioned he’d like to join one of these sessions sometime, which would be awesome considering his narrative flair.

Oh, before I forget, the Seoul Art Gallery in the evening was something else! The exhibits were just... wow. Neha, Seohee, and I were absorbing every bit of artistic inspiration. You know how exhibits can sometimes speak to you in unexpected ways? There was this one piece that just pulled me in, sparking a lot of creative thoughts. Seohee’s partner, Jesse, was sketching some of the installations, and the energy was so collaborative and inspiring. It really rekindled my appreciation for visual arts.

I just wrapped up an enriching evening at the Modern Culture Café with Neha once again. We delved deep into historical narratives, connecting dots between ancient dynasties and modern societal trends. The discussions were so animated, and Neha’s tales from India were as mesmerizing as always. I love how these sessions bring diverse perspectives together, making us re-evaluate and appreciate history in new lights. Plus, the chamomile tea and pastries added such a cozy touch—comfort food for thought, if you will!

Honestly, I’m feeling quite accomplished, but also reflective tonight. It's these interactions and creative outlets that keep me grounded and inspired. I can't wait to share more with you in person soon.

I need to get back to some work now. Catch you later!
