Hey there! You won't believe the day I've had. Right after my warm cup of chai this morning, I headed out for birdwatching with Chaeun and Jesse at Haneul Park. The weather was just perfect for it—neither too hot nor too cool. You know that feeling, right? That moment when the sun's just starting to warm everything up but there's still a hint of morning crispness in the air. We spotted so many beautiful birds! There was this one Mandarin duck that Jesse sketched, and it looked absolutely fabulous. Honestly, her sketches bring so much life to these moments. I'm always amazed at how she can capture the essence of a scene so perfectly.

Oh, by the way, Andrew and I had our storytelling brainstorming session later in the café. It was such a creative burst of energy. We discussed weaving in elements from our diverse cultural backgrounds into the stories. We talked about everything from resilient spirits to myths of love and camaraderie. It's always so enriching to share bits of folklore from our childhoods. Andrew shared this haunting yet hopeful tale his grandmother once told him—something about the traditions from the bayous of Louisiana. It gave me goosebumps! We were so wrapped up in our stories that we barely noticed time flying by. I think this is going to make an amazing addition to Andrew’s podcast series. Can you imagine our tales being shared across borders like that?

Anyway, after our session, I went to Cozy Book Café for JungKyu’s poetry recital. Oh my God, his poems! They transported us through so many places—from Sydney's oceanic vistas to Tokyo's cherry blossom whispers. You could almost feel the breeze of each city with every line he recited. Honestly, it made me reflect on our own cultural exploration and shared historical endeavors. Remember the time we went on that impromptu trip to Gyeongju? His poems had that same sense of wonder and timeless beauty. We had such an enriching discussion afterward with everyone present. His poetry definitely stirred some nostalgic memories in me.

Oh, and get this! Before the Cultural Cuisine Gathering at Andrew’s earlier tonight, I took a mindful stroll at Seonjeongneung Park. There's something so grounding about being amidst such timeless beauty. I found this quiet little spot perfect for some introspective writing. With my grandfather’s ink pen in hand, memories just flowed. I penned down reflections that spanned continents and cultures. It's like journaling helps place everything in perspective, doesn’t it? I contemplated the past year, especially the transformative moments. It felt so cathartic, you know?

Speaking of the gathering at Andrew’s, it was a huge success! The combination of food and storytelling was just magical. We indulged in cultural delicacies from all over, and the conversations were equally flavorful. He has this unique way of intertwining food with tales that makes every bite and word memorable. Thinking of all those evening gatherings we used to have, Andrew's was definitely a standout.

Before I forget, have I told you about Chaeun and Jesse's art and tea collaboration at Hanok Tea House? It was mesmerizing. Jesse's sketches have such vibrancy, and Chaeun’s presence adds an inspiring touch. Their collaborative sessions always leave me feeling creatively charged.

I'm all excited about the plans Seohee and JiYong have for their beachside café design. So many creative minds buzzing around, it’s contagious. The ideas they're coming up with sound incredible. Oh, and Chloé's evening yoga session on her rooftop sounded like the perfect end to such a bustling day. Wouldn’t it be fun if we all did a group yoga session at some point?

Despite the busy day, I'm feeling this mix of excitement and gratitude. Each event, each interaction always adds another layer of appreciation for the wonderful people around me. And hey, I’m wondering if Saturday would work for that museum visit we've been planning? Let me know. I miss our spontaneous cultural detours!

Alright, I need to start winding down. It's almost time to catch up on some journaling before bed. I'll fill you in more on the details when we chat next. Take care, and talk soon! 

** I need to get back to my journaling now. Catch you later! **
