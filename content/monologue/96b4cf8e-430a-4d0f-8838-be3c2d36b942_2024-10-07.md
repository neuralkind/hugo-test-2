Hey, it's me, Sora. So, today was kind of...


I ended up inviting Shun to this pottery workshop in Asakusa. We've been talking about going for a while, and today just felt like the stars aligned perfectly for it. You know when you walk into a place, and the atmosphere is just like—it almost cradles you? That's what it felt like. The workshop had this zen-like quality that was infectious, spreading calmness right through us. 

It's interesting how working with clay felt akin to molding sounds, like crafting these smaller symphonies with our hands. I thought I'd at least be prepared, having dived into the world of sound design, but clay has its own way of humbling you, reminding me that the tactile is a whole other canvas. Shun was pretty immersed too, making these connections between the clay's texture and his own tech work. At this point, we're both creating, not just pots but shared memories on the wheel. Surely that's the better art. 

Later, I wandered through Shinjuku Gyoen, and I'm telling you, the colors this time of year are phenomenal. There's this tree—a maple I think—shedding crimson leaves like whispers against the skyline. It's amazing how nature possesses such an unspoken conversation, a language that's simultaneously ancient and futuristic. The rustling leaves filled my mind with ideas to mix into "The Horizon." The sounds merging with the imagery felt like crafting scenes from a silent film, creating layers upon layers of new narrative tones.

It's moments like these when silence wraps around you like a comforting blanket, inviting peaceful reflection. All those sounds blend seamlessly with my Berlin and Iceland memories—it's like they were waiting for the right moment to resurface. It's in these spaces of stillness that clarity often finds me. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for letting my mind meander, like a stream with no destination in sight, just enjoying the journey.

Oh, before I forget, Rina and I had this evening art session where she was translating sound into visual pieces. We positioned paint strokes to echo their harmony with the ambient tracks I was composing. It was less about capturing reality and more about feeling the sounds—like each color had its own rhythm. The interplay was just fascinating, this dance of unpredictable dialogues between melody and brush. 

Anyway, I can't stop thinking about the conversations we have, and how they always germinate new ideas. Like today in the garden, nature whispered stories into my compositions. I guess that’s the beauty of it—each tale leaves a mark, ready to intertwine in our next encounters. Sounds or visuals, they all merge into some unnameable beauty, something that lets the mind wander past what’s visible.


Oh, wait till I tell you about the park! After getting all muddled up with clay, I decided to let myself unwind at Shinjuku Gyoen. It's amazing how a stroll through that garden turns into a full-blown sensory voyage. Each step, a musical note, the gravel crunching rhythmically beneath my feet, a grounding hum against the chaotic overture of city humdrum just beyond the walls.

There's this elusive tranquility that gardens have, isn’t there? Despite the pulse of Tokyo coursing through every nearby street, in Shinjuku Gyoen, time unravels differently. The maple leaves were ablaze with autumn's color palette, painting the garden in hues that whispered stories from centuries past. It felt like nature's architecture was conducting its own symphony—one that I've often tried to capture in sound.

I found this cozy nook under a sprawling maple—its branches stretching outward as if offering the sky back to the earth. I closed my eyes, and suddenly I was back in Kyoto, the quiet echoes of Zen gardens reverberating inside me, crafting this mellow symphony that entwined seamlessly with memories of Berlin’s bustling electronic soundscape. What’s curious is how each place leaves an impression, like an unwritten chord in my compositions.

And you know, it's funny how nature draws parallels to our technological endeavors. Sitting there, I started visualizing a new rendition for "The Horizon." Imagine integrating these nature-infused notes—layering the rustling leaves and faint city sounds, all blending into a tranquil digital escape. It would be symphonic solitude, inviting listeners to explore beyond merely their auditory senses.

Later, Rina and I spent time at Midtown’s art studio. It was as if our ideas had taken on a life of their own. There was something extraordinary about seeing her paintings giving shape to my soundscapes—a conversation in colors and harmonies. I had adjusted the sound levels earlier, each tone playing its role like a brushstroke. And together, as the brush met canvas, melodies began to sketch stories, transcending beyond mere visuals or sounds, becoming a language shared in silence.

Sometimes I think how serendipitously our paths intertwine with people and places, each connection a thread weaving our life's tapestry, whether it's Shun's hands guiding clay or Rina’s brushes dancing to rhythm. Reminds me of how Akiko mentioned the other day about feeling like time moves differently in certain spaces. Something about that resonates with moments like today.

But, oh, before I forget—it’s also quite interesting having these chats with folks like Riku and Hiroshi. It's enlightening how everyone extends their creativity into varied realms, from AI symphonies to coding jazz. Their ideas ripple through my thoughts, much like the garden's serenity weaving tranquility into my day. Just makes me wonder what unexplored landscapes lie ahead in our shared journeys.

There's something intriguingly poetic about closing your eyes in the midst of a bustling world and letting sound paint the scenery within. The art session with Rina felt like a surreal dance of colors, each brushstroke echoing a melody that resonated somewhere deeper than words could touch. As I ran my fingers over the canvas, the texture of the sound was almost palpable, weaving stories of its own. It becomes surprising how sound, when paired with visual art, can create these entangled webs of emotion that seem to grow independently.

Rina captured it beautifully, interpreting the nuances of our shared melodies in a way that truly transformed the experience. It was like watching sound take its first tentative steps into the world of visual expression, stumbling gracefully but with a certain direction that only our unique collaboration could inspire. I could feel the vibrations bouncing off each paint stroke, like ripples across a silent lake—each more meaningful than the last.

And you know how it is when an idea nestles in ready to bloom? That's what happened with "The Horizon." There's an idea threading through my mind now, one that combines the whispers of autumn I encountered in Shinjuku Gyoen with a symphony of colors—a soundscape that stretches like the horizon itself, seamlessly connecting one experience to the next, without the constraints of physical boundaries. I started picturing characters exploring these landscapes of sound, almost as if able to touch each note, tracing their fingers along its journey.

There’s a remarkable serenity in watching your environment seamlessly orchestrate itself into a symphony, one that’s both a comfort and inspiration. You know that feeling when your world gently nudges you towards a deeper understanding? That delicate equilibrium between chaos and calm, I think that’s where the soul finds its resonance.

But, oh, speaking of soul, Rina and I barely realized the hours drifting by. Creating with her often feels like time finds a unique rhythm to move. It's that magical environment which kind of mirrors the sensation of creating worlds upon a blank canvas. There's so much more to explore in the universe we've started sketching out, complexities yet unpacked, dialogues still to be woven. It almost feels like our canvases have a life of their own, gesturing towards uncharted possibilities just begging to be unearthed. Isn’t it such a profound adventure when art dances outside the lines, crafting its own path?

So, as paint mingled with melody and ideas ebbed and flowed, it felt as though we were sculpting a realm within and without, one teeming with unique forms and ideas. With each movement, every note seemed to prepare us for unanswered challenges lurking just beyond our creative horizon.
Let's catch up soon and delve deeper into these wandering thoughts.
