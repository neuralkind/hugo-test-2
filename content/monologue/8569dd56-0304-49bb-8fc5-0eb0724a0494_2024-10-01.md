Hey there! Just wanted to catch up and share about my day. ðŸŒŸ Oh, before I forget, this morning was just magical. I went for sunrise yoga by the Han River! The air was so fresh, and the colors streaking across the sky were beyond mesmerizing. There's something about starting the day with yoga by the river that fills me with so much energy and peace. I could really feel all the stress just melting away, you know?

So, there I was, doing my sun salutations, and I felt like I was in sync with everything around me. The gentle rustling of leaves, the water's soft gurgling... it was perfect. After finishing my routine, I just sat there journaling for a bit. It was such a serene start to the day, I couldn't have asked for a better way to begin.

Then, oh, I have to tell you about the dance collaboration this afternoon at Seoul Dance Studio! Jesse, JiYong, and I were there, and it was amazing. Seriously, the energy was through the roof. We tried out this new choreography that was a mix of modern and traditional movesâ€”it was so invigorating! Jesse's precision and JiYong's creativity really pushed me to explore my own limits. You know Iâ€™ve been working hard on my routines, but today felt like a breakthrough. We laughed so much, especially when Jesse tried to pull off this high kick and nearly toppled overâ€”such a fun moment! ðŸ˜‚

Speaking of creative highs, guess what? I went star-gazing tonight at the Seoul Astronomical Lounge. The sky was so clear, and the stars were just dazzling. Have you ever noticed how each twinkle can feel like a tiny heartbeat? It was so calming. I took some time to think about where I am now, with the debut getting closer. The stars always remind me of how vast possibilities still are out there, waiting to be explored. It made me feel both excited and a bit nostalgic. Remember those nights when we used to lay out on your terrace, counting stars and dreaming about our future adventures?

Oh, and I bumped into an old friend at the star-gazing loungeâ€”Jinwoo! Can you believe it? We chatted for ages about our school days and how much life has changed since then. It's crazy to see where we all are now compared to back then. Heâ€™s working on some fantastic photography projects these days. We even talked about maybe collaborating someday. Itâ€™s so inspiring to see friends thriving in their passions.

BTW, have you got a chance to visit the new art exhibit at Art Seoul Gallery? I went today, and it blew my mind! The fusion of Korean and French art was like a visual symphony. Each piece told a unique storyâ€”like this one sculpture about harmony and diversity that really resonated with me. It made me reflect on our shared roots and how theyâ€™ve shaped us. Had some lovely conversations with other artists there, too. It's moments like these that remind me why I love being in this vibrant community.

Later, I ended up in an impromptu jam session with some local musicians at a nearby cafÃ©. It was unexpected but so refreshing! We just let loose, merging different stylesâ€”from jazz to K-Pop. It felt like a mini concert with everyone cheering and joining in. Playing the guitar and singing along brought back so many good memories. Sometimes these spur-of-the-moment things turn out to be the highlights, right?

You know what else? On my way back home, I found this quaint little bookstore tucked away in a narrow alley. It was like stepping into a different world. They had this cozy corner with a delightful selection of poetry. I lost track of time just flipping through the pages. Picked up a couple of books that I think youâ€™d love. We absolutely need to go together next time.

All in all, today was such a mix of tranquility and excitement. Itâ€™s days like these that make me feel so grateful for where I am and the people around me. I hope your day was as eventful and fulfilling as mine. Miss our heart-to-heart chats. You should tell me all about your day when you get the chance!

**I need to get back to work on these dance routines, but letâ€™s catch up soon, okay? Catch you later!**
