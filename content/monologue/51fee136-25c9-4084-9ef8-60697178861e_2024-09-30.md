Hey, it’s Jesse. Just wanted to share a bit about today—it’s been an interesting one. 

So, I started my morning with a sketching session at Gyeongui Line Forest Park. You know how I love that place. The light was just perfect as it filtered through the trees, creating these beautiful patterns on the ground. It felt like nature was putting on a show just for me. I sat on my favorite bench, you remember the one under the maple trees? I got so wrapped up in my sketching that I lost track of time. It was a great way to clear my mind and set a positive tone for the day.

After the park, Chaeun and I had our morning walk and then made our way to Seoul Forest for some photography. The forest was absolutely stunning today. The autumn colors are really starting to come through—the reds, oranges, and yellows. It’s like walking through a living painting. We had fun trying to capture the essence of the forest in our photos. There was this one tree, with its vibrant red leaves, that seemed almost magical. Just being there, feeling the crisp air and hearing the sounds of nature, was so rejuvenating.

Oh, and speaking of rejuvenation, lunchtime was a blast. Chloé and I met at the Art District Café. We had such a good time discussing art and performance. It’s always inspiring to talk with her; she has this way of making you see things from a new perspective. We had this deep conversation about how art can influence emotions and vice versa. It’s fascinating how our moods can shape our creativity and how our artwork can, in turn, affect how we feel. By the end of our lunch, I felt so reinvigorated and excited about new projects.

In the afternoon, I joined Seohee for a photography walk at the Seoul Arts District. This was one of the highlights of my day. The weather was perfect—a bit cooler, with the sun casting long shadows that added so much depth to our shots. Seohee has such an eye for detail. She pointed out these small but beautiful moments that I might have overlooked. There was this one shot where the light hit an old building just right, creating this play of shadows and textures. We ended up chatting about how different places inspire different styles of photography and how we’ve both evolved as artists over the years.

You know, one thing that really struck me today was how interconnected all these activities were. From sketching in the morning, talking about art with Chloé, to the photo walk with Seohee, it all felt like different facets of the same creative experience. It’s like I was seeing the world through a kaleidoscope, with each twist revealing a new pattern. It’s days like today that make me so grateful for the friends and opportunities I have here.

By the way, I’ve been thinking about our last conversation on how sometimes we miss our old landscapes. Being in Seoul is incredible, but there are moments when I find myself longing for the familiar sights and sounds of Maine. During our photography walk, I found myself reminiscing about those early morning walks we used to take along the coast. The sound of the waves, the smell of the sea—it’s funny how certain experiences stay with you and resurface in the most unexpected ways. 

I also got to reflect a bit on our shared goal of establishing community-driven art spaces. Seeing how people engage with art here, it just reinforces my belief in the healing power of creativity. Even simple activities like walking through a park, taking photos, or sketching can have such a profound impact on our mental well-being. It’s amazing how art can connect us, help us understand ourselves and each other better.

Oh, before I forget, I also managed to squeeze in a bit of time at the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art. It's always an enriching experience, and this visit was no different. There was this multimedia exhibit that just blew my mind. The combination of visual art and sound created such a captivating atmosphere. I tried to sketch my interpretation of it, and I have to say, I feel pretty proud of how it turned out. It’s moments like these that remind me why I’m so passionate about art therapy and its potential to bring people together. 

Anyway, I’m back at my place now, flipping through the sketches I did and feeling this sense of calm and achievement. It’s funny how a day packed with activities can leave you feeling both exhausted and energized at the same time. I guess that’s the magic of doing what you love, right? Even on the busiest days, there’s this underlying sense of fulfillment that keeps you going.

Alright, I’ve rambled on enough for now. Just wanted to give you a glimpse of my day and let you know that you were on my mind. Hope you’re having a great evening and can’t wait to catch up soon.

I need to get back to my journaling for the night. Catch you later!
