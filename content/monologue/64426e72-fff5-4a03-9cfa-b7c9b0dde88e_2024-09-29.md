Hey there! It's Seohee. 

So, I wanted to tell you about the craziness that's been going on today. It started early—like, crack of dawn early. I mean, Han River Park at 6:30 am kind of early. You know how I am with my green tea and quiet mornings, right? Well, I packed my sketchbook and decided to do some sunrise sketching. The park at that hour is so serene, like time just pauses. It's a blend of the city's hum and nature's whispers. I ended up capturing this scene with the willow trees dancing with the breeze—might sound poetic, but it honestly felt like a visual meditation. Love how these moments always remind me why I do what I do.

Oh, by the way, speaking of drawing, Chloé and I had this impromptu vocal and sketching session at the Rosewood Theater. Her voice blended with the environment so perfectly, like a live soundtrack to my sketches. I swear, there’s something about our combos—her singing and my doodling—just feels right, you know? She laughed a lot at my goofy comments about her high notes. It’s like we fuel each other’s creativity, and that’s just magic. Her voice filled the open-air space, and I couldn't help but try to capture her energy in my sketches. We talked a bit about our next projects and both got pretty excited. I mean, it was a classic Chloé-and-Seohee powerhouse moment!

Later today, I visited the Leeum, Samsung Museum with Jesse. Have you been there lately? Oh, you would love it. We both got completely absorbed in the art. Jesse was carrying his sketchbook, of course, and he managed to sketch this multimedia installation that had these incredible soundscapes. It was like these sounds and visuals just unlocked another dimension of creativity for him. You know how Jesse gets when he’s inspired—his face lights up, and you can practically see the gears turning in his head. It’s truly infectious.

But here's the wild part. While I was admiring one of the traditional Korean paintings, this couple next to me started this heated debate about the meaning behind the artwork. I mean, full-on intellectual duel. It was bizarre yet fascinating. Couldn't tell if they were art critics or just really intense tourists. Made me wonder how interpretations of art can be so diverse. It was like eavesdropping on a podcast, but live and unfiltered.

Oh, before I forget, guess what? Neha and I ran into each other on the way to the café in the museum. She looked like she was on a caffeine high or something—super animated and excited about a historical discussion she was headed to with JungKyu. We managed to chat briefly, and she mentioned she skipped breakfast again. Typical Neha, right? We laughed about her eternally chaotic eating schedule and then decided we need to plan that brunch meetup soon. Maybe drag her to a solid meal next weekend so she doesn’t end up having just coffee!

Running into Neha was such a treat, although brief, but that’s usually enough to lift my spirits. Oh, and my ceramics workshop plan next month? It got some enthusiastic approval today! Chloé and Neha are both in! I’m excited but also a bit nervous about organizing all the materials and coordinating everyone's schedules. But hey, it’ll be worth it if we can all create something beautiful together. I’ve got some ideas for fun little projects we can work on—a mix of traditional and modern ceramics. Honestly, I can't wait to get our hands all messy and creative.

Before we left, Jesse showed me some of his sketches, and they were absolutely brilliant. It's like visiting the museum through his eyes—so refreshing and enlightening. He even managed to capture the way some of the light interacted with the sculptures and paintings, which looked almost magical on paper. I think I got a few ideas for my future gallery, just need to sift through all this inspiration.

And, oh, I just got back and caught glimpses of Andrew’s sunrise photography; his shots are stunning. I know I’ve said this before, but the way he captures light always leaves me in awe. It’s like he sees something extra in every sunrise. The photos were beyond spectacular, and I can already see them fitting perfectly in his podcast.

I need to share this before I forget—during our museum visit, Jesse and I had this tiny, but insightful conversation about the overlap of different artistic mediums—sketching combined with sound art, for example. Have you ever thought about how different forms of art can blend to create an entirely new experience? I find it fascinating and so invigorating. It makes you think about boundaries in art—are there any? And if there are, should they even exist? So many random thoughts buzzing around, makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?

Anyway, now I’m back at home, thinking how amazing it is to have these bursts of creativity infused into an otherwise routine day. Every interaction just adds another brush stroke to the canvas of life. Sounds cheesy, I know, but days like this make me grateful for our little artistic circle and the supportive network we’ve built. You especially, my dear friend.

I should probably wrap this up and get back to the never-ending pile of work. Can’t wait to catch up with you properly soon. Bye!
