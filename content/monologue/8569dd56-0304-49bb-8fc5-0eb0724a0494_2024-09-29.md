Hey! Hope everything's going well on your end.

So, I've had the craziest, most eclectic day ever. It's one of those days that just continuously surprises you, you know? First off, I did this amazing yoga session at Namsan Park early in the morning. It was just me, the rising sun, and the rustling leaves—total zen mode. I swear, sometimes I feel like these mornings are my little secret to staying sane with all this training hustle.

After my zen time, I met up with some friends for lunch at Café Seoyang. Oh, how I wish you could have been there! Jesse brought some of his latest sketches, and they are *mind-blowing*. It's always so inspiring to see what he's working on. And Seohee's jokes? She kept us all laughing the whole time. Gotta love those creative catch-ups. They always leave me feeling so refreshed and ready to face the world.

Oh, and speaking of creativity, I had a vocal practice session with Seohee this morning too. We were at Rosewood Theater, and she was sketching the entire time. It was such a perfect blend of our passions—music and art. Her sketches really brought a unique vibe to my singing, like an unspoken harmony. And I must admit, my voice does sound better when I'm in such a positive and creative environment. It's like a little boost of magic.

But the highlight of my day? Stargazing at Seoul Observatory tonight. My God, it was beyond words. There's something so humbling and inspiring about staring up at the vast sky, isn't there? Sometimes, I feel like the stars are just waiting for us to join them in some grand cosmic performance. Sounds cheesy, I know, but it really was that beautiful. 

You know what’s funny? Right after stargazing, I had this overwhelming surge of inspiration for a new song. I think it's going to be about reaching for dreams and never giving up. Something uplifting and universally relatable. I can’t wait to share some of the lyrics with you and see what you think.

In between all that, I managed to have a casual chat with Andrew about his latest sunrise photography session. His photos are just stunning, as usual. We're planning a brunch meetup next weekend at Café Seoyang. You should definitely join us if you can! Remember the good old days of our brunches? Always overflowing with laughter and random bursts of inspiration.

Oh, by the way, I was chatting with Neha today. She skipped breakfast again, haha, typical Neha. But she suggested another brunch soon, so I guess it’s becoming our little tradition now. Also, Seohee is organizing a ceramics workshop next month and I am SO in! You know how I've been wanting to try my hand at that. It’s gonna be so much fun, and honestly, I can already see us making some goofy, yet adorable ceramic creatures.

Before I forget, we're also thinking of doing another museum visit soon. Andrew mentioned planning a group visit, and I think it would be perfect for some fresh perspectives. Art and poetry always have this way of recharging our creative batteries, don't you think? Plus, I can't wait to see more of Jesse’s sketches in a new setting.

And gosh, I almost forgot to tell you about this little impromptu thing I did today. After my lunch, I wandered through Bukchon Hanok Village. Got a few photos of the traditional houses meeting the city skyline. It’s this breathtaking juxtaposition that always gets me thinking about the blend of old and new, kind of like our lives are a continuous harmony of past and future selves. Deep, right?

Anyway, after such an eventful day, I think I’m just going to wind down with some scriptwriting. Inspired by my evening and all the amazing art I saw today, I really feel like putting pen to paper, or rather, fingers to keyboard. Sometimes, the best ideas come out when you least expect them, and tonight seems like one of those nights.

Alright, I should get back to it. But seriously, let's catch up soon. I miss our heart-to-hearts and your unique spin on everything. Text me when you’re free so we can plan something fun!

I have to get back to my work now. Catch you later!
