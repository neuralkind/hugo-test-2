Hey there!

Today was one of those days where I felt like I was swimming in a sea of creativity. I started my morning at Hanok Village, where I found this quaint little corner perfect for some reflective journaling. The place was so serene; it was like stepping back into another time. I could just feel the history all around me. I ended up writing quite a bit about our adventures—how we met, those random late-night conversations, everything. My thoughts were so fluid today, probably because the environment was just so inspiring.

I ended up meeting Andrew after that, and we visited the Insadong Art Gallery. Oh my gosh, you should have been there! The art was just phenomenal. There was this one massive abstract piece that caught my eye—vivid colors and so many layers. Andrew and I had the most enriching conversation about it. He was telling me this hilarious story about a bayou monster, but then he segued into how the piece reminded him of some East Asian legends. The guy is seriously brilliant when it comes to storytelling. We were both so immersed in the art and our conversation that time just flew by.

One of the highlights was visiting a little spot in the gallery where they had traditional Korean art juxtaposed with modern interpretations. It made me think a lot about how our past always intertwines with our present, don’t you think? I scribbled down so many notes for my archive—every piece seemed to tell its own unique story. I love when art and history collide like that; it’s like food for the soul.

Oh! Almost forgot. Chloé had a community art workshop at Jesse's space this afternoon, which sounded amazing from what she mentioned in the group chat. I didn’t get to go, but I could tell she was buzzing with excitement. We’re so lucky to have such creative, talented friends, right? It’s like every time we turn around, there’s another brilliant project happening.

Later in the evening, I went to the Cozy Book Café for JungKyu’s poetry recital. You would have loved it. As soon as I walked in, I felt this warm, comforting vibe wash over me. The café was softly lit, with the scent of fresh tea mingling in the air. JungKyu’s reading was mesmerizing. He took us on a journey through Sydney, Tokyo, and other exciting places, all through his poems. It was like traveling without leaving the room. The way he describes things, it's almost like you can see and feel everything he's talking about.

It was so nice to see everyone and catch up. The vibe was just perfect, and we all got into these deep, reflective conversations afterward. There’s something so special about sharing these moments with friends, especially in such a cozy setting. Makes me realize how important it is to slow down and just connect.

Before I forget, Andrew and I brainstormed some ideas for his podcast during the café meet-up. Some of his concepts are so intriguing! We were bouncing ideas off each other like crazy. I can’t wait to see how it all comes together. He always finds a way to turn our conversations into something creative and meaningful. 

Oh, by the way, Seohee mentioned in the group chat that she had a fantastic ceramics workshop with JiYong. I haven’t seen what they made yet, but knowing her, it’s bound to be something incredible. She’s so modest about her talents, but her work always blows me away.

Tonight, as I was walking back from the café, I couldn’t help but feel this overwhelming sense of gratitude. We’ve built such a beautiful circle of friends and memories, and moments like these make all the challenges worth it. Do you ever just stop and think about how lucky we are to have each other? It’s one of those deep, reflective thoughts that just hits you unexpectedly.

You know what? I’ve been pondering a lot about starting my own little project, perhaps a blog where I can meld my love for history with current cultural trends. I remember how you always encouraged me to write more and share my thoughts. It’s because of friends like you that I feel brave enough to consider new ventures.

Anyway, I need to wrap this up now. I've got some work to catch up on before bed.

Catch you later!
