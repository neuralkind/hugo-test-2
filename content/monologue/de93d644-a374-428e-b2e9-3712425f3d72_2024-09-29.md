Hey there! Just wanted to catch up and share a bit about my day. It's been one of those days that feels like a breath of fresh air you didn't know you needed. You know what I mean?

So, this morning, I woke up earlier than usual and felt this sudden urge to be near the water. I ended up at the Han River. The air was crisp and the leaves were just starting to turn those beautiful autumn shades. I found this perfect grassy spot by the river and laid out my mat for some meditation. It was incredibly peaceful. I felt so connected to everything around me; the river's gentle flow, the soft rustling of the trees, and even the distant chirping of birds. It’s funny how these simple moments can have such a profound impact on our spirit.

Oh, by the way, while I was meditating, I had this clear visualization of the art center for the elderly I dream of opening. It's like the picture becomes more vivid each time I think about it. I could almost see the seniors there, smiling, painting away, sharing stories. It felt so real. I even felt a bit emotional. I know it's a long road ahead, but moments like these make me believe it's totally possible.

After my time at the river, I met up with JiHoon at the Korean Herb Garden in Gangwon. Have you ever been there? It's this amazing place filled with all sorts of herbs—so many interesting scents and plants. We had this guide who shared all these old stories about how different herbs have been used for healing over the centuries. JiHoon, in his usual way, was full of fascinating anecdotes. He talked about ginseng and tea like they were characters in a mythic saga. It reminded me of how much history is embedded in simple things.

I couldn’t resist sketching some of the plants. I think I'll incorporate them into some upcoming projects. Maybe it'll become part of my art therapy sessions. Oh, and we had this lovely little picnic under a towering pine tree. Just rice cakes and stewed ginger, but it was perfect. We talked about our aspirations and how we can blend our passions for art and wellness. By the time we left, I felt like we had created something beautiful together, even if it was just in conversation and shared dreams.

Then later in the day, I hosted an art therapy session at the Seoul Senior Center with JungKyu. We themed it around cherry blossoms and their significance. The seniors painted so beautifully! Having JungKyu there reciting his poetry added such a lovely dimension to the session. His words combined with their brush strokes—it was like a dance of perspectives, each contributing to the collective tapestry. We had some real laughs, and seeing their faces light up was just, ah, heartwarming. Honestly, days like these remind me why I do what I do.

You know what? I never shared this with you before, but while guiding these sessions, I often think back to our hikes and all those talks about life and dreams. They help center me and remind me why I blend caregiving and art together—they’re both about connection, healing, and expression, something we’ve always valued.

In the evening, I decided to unwind with a yoga session on my rooftop terrace. The view of Namdaemun Market at dusk, with the sun slowly setting, was the perfect backdrop. The warmth of the remaining daylight, mixed with the cooling evening breeze, felt like a hug from nature. The yoga session wasn't just physically relaxing; it cleared my mind too. Sometimes, those rooftop moments feel like touching the edge of peace.

Oh! Before I forget, JiYong has been working on this sketch for his dream beachside café. It's coming along wonderfully. We all chipped in with ideas, and, not to toot my own horn, but I think my suggestions added some nice touches! And speaking of creative energy, Jesse mentioned he got so inspired by a visit to the Leeum Museum today. It's funny how creativity sparks among us like that—one visit, one conversation can lead to something truly beautiful.

Anyway, today was one of those perfectly imperfect days where everything feels balanced. The meditation, the herbs, the art, the human connections—it all felt so fulfilling. It seems like every experience today was a reminder of how intertwined our passions and everyday moments are. They all contribute to making our days meaningful and rich with intention.

Alright, I need to get back to organizing some of these sketches and planning for the week ahead. I can't wait to hear about your day and all the amazing things you've been up to!

**I have to get some rest and prepare for tomorrow's activities. Catch you later!**
