Hey there!

I wanted to give you a quick recap of my day, which was pretty eventful from the moment I woke up! You know how I love starting my mornings with a bit of calm. Today, I decided to merge my meditation session with some piano improvisation. It’s amazing how mixing those two passions of mine can set such a peaceful tone for the day. Those keys were practically telling me stories from Sydney and Shanghai. I could almost see those oceanic vistas and cherry blossom lanes just through the melodies. Seriously, it felt like time just slipped away as I played.

So, after that serene start, I headed to the Seoul National Museum of Art. I invited Neha to join me because we haven't had a chance to hang out much this week. The museum always gives me fresh perspectives, and I thought it might inspire some new verses for tonight’s recital. We wandered through the exhibits, chatting about everything from the strokes in a painting to our own creative processes. One piece really caught my eye—it was this abstract representation of urban life. It made me think of all the different paths our lives have taken but how they all intersect now in this vibrant city.

And speaking of creativity, just in case you didn't catch this in the chat earlier, Chloé had a bit of a culinary adventure with some French-Korean fusion dishes. Oh, and by the way, Chaeun went to Gwangalli Beach Café to do some writing, which always sounds so lovely and serene. I can almost imagine the ocean breeze mixing with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Makes me want to take a trip to Busan one of these days for a mini retreat.

Oh, before I forget, Chloé suggested she might cook for all of us someday, maybe we could gather for a mini feast. I think it would be great to have everyone together, sharing good food and stories, just like old times. What do you think?

This evening was all about my poetry recital. To be honest, I was a bit nervous, butterflies and all. But once I began reading, I felt this incredible wave of calm, as if each word was an old friend. The audience was intimate, cozy even, which made it easier to let my guard down. I caught Neha’s eye a couple of times, and her encouraging nod really kept me grounded. I recited poems that took everyone on a journey from Sydney’s shores to the tranquil corners of Tokyo. It felt like each verse was a postcard, sending them snapshots of my adventures. 

Oh, you've gotta hear about this moment during the recital! I was midway through a poem about Han River walks when someone’s phone went off with the most jarring ringtone. It was so unexpected, I couldn’t help but laugh, and the audience joined in. It actually broke the ice and lightened the mood perfectly. Sometimes, the universe really does have a sense of humor.

By the way, during our museum visit, Neha and I reminisced a bit about our own journey. You know, navigating new cultures, reflecting on shared moments from exchange programs, and how those experiences have shaped us. It’s kind of amazing how these reflections end up in my poetry. It’s like weaving threads from our past into something tangible. Neha even suggested I compile these pieces into a collection. What do you think about that idea? It could be a fun project to dive into.

I do have to say, tonight’s event was a beautiful reminder of why I love poetry—it's a bridge between people, stories, and emotions that transcend the everyday hustle. Even bumped into a few familiar faces who had attended my past recitals. Always wonderful to see how your words resonate with people over time.

And, oh, post-recital, we all gathered for a small toast. It wasn’t anything grand, just a few friends clinking glasses to celebrate the evening, sharing a laugh and a few more stories. Felt like the perfect wrap to an exquisite day filled with art, reflection, and creativity.

You know, I’ve been thinking about hosting a little gathering at my place soon. Maybe an evening of music and poetry. I can play some of my piano compositions, and we can have an open mic for anyone who wants to share a poem or two. It could be a lovely way to bring everyone together before we get too deep into the winter hustle.

Oh, speaking of winter, have you started planning any travels? I’ve been itching to visit somewhere new. Maybe another exchange program or just a short cultural trip? Always something to think about!

Alright, I better not ramble on too much. Just wanted to share these snippets of my day with you. Hope yours was good too—catch up soon, yeah?

**Need to get back to prepping for tomorrow’s tasks. Catch you later!**
