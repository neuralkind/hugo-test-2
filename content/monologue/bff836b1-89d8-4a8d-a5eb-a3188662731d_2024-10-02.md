Hey, it's JiYong. Just wanted to catch up with you about today.

You know, I was thinking about how everyone's morning sounded so refreshing—from yoga by the river to meditation at Yeouido Park. Honestly, I can't believe I had an early start myself. It's almost like I joined the morning club, but instead of a serene walk, I had a carpentry session. Quite a way to kick off the day, huh?

So, I spent a good couple of hours in the workshop working on that new coffee table design inspired by Busan. The scent of freshly cut wood and sandalwood incense made the whole space feel like a mini retreat. I can't help but feel a deep sense of connection when I'm carving and shaping the wood. It’s like each tap of the chisel brings me a step closer to a memory I cherish from back home. I was in my element—immersed in the rhythm of the tools and the scent of wood. Almost poetic, don’t you think?

Later in the day, I had an incredible ceramics workshop with Seohee. We tried this new technique integrating bamboo strands into the clay, and it was fascinating to watch it all come together. Seohee’s floral engravings on the pieces were simply stunning. There’s something really rewarding about experimenting and seeing our ideas take shape right before our eyes. Actually, I think we might've stumbled onto something unique—maybe we can incorporate some of these designs into the décor for that dream beachside café.

Oh, and by the way, I had a fantastic coffee session with Andrew and Neha at a local café. It was raining outside, which gave the place a really cozy vibe. We spread out our sketches and mood boards, talking about potential layouts for the café. Andrew's storytelling corner idea got me excited, and we even thought about having a 'Stories Bench' where visitors can share their own snippets. Can you imagine how lively that place would be? A blend of coastal snacks, aromatic teas, and stories passed around like sea breezes. I still remember Andrew's chuckle as he envisioned bohemian murals inspired by New Orleans tales—felt like our ideas were flowing in sync. 

And speaking of art, I also joined an art meetup at Insadong Art Gallery with Andrew this evening. The place was buzzing with creativity—each piece seemed to tell a story on its own. Andrew was capturing photos for his podcast inspiration while Neha provided historical insights about the motifs. Their banter was infectious, and it made me appreciate how art can bring so many different perspectives together. I even managed to snap a few shots myself, thinking we might use some of these inspirations for the café’s interior.

Today felt so rich and full. Each activity seemed to intertwine with the others, like threads in a tapestry. It's days like these that make me grateful for the blend of creativity and connection I have with friends. 

Before I forget, I saw Jesse cooking with Chloé this morning through our chat. Can you imagine Jesse in the kitchen? I never took him for a culinary person. It’s funny how we all have these hidden talents. Maybe we should all cook together sometime—could be a fun and chaotic experience!

Oh, a quick thought—there's an evening sketching session at Namsan later. Sounds like a serene way to wrap up the day. Might head there after dinner; the cityscape sketches always amaze me. If you've got time, maybe we can join sometime together. Evenings at Namsan are pretty magical. 

You know, amidst all the bustle today, there's this lingering sense of fulfillment. Connecting with friends, immersing in creative pursuits, and even planning bits of the café dream—it all feels like parts of a bigger picture falling into place. I wonder if we'll look back at these moments and see just how much they shaped our paths.

Anyway, I need to grab some dinner now. Jesse and Chloé mentioned they were up for sharing our sketches over some good food. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's art and hearing their stories. It's these little gatherings that make the end of the day feel so complete.

I need to get back to some final sketches after dinner. Catch you later. Bye!
