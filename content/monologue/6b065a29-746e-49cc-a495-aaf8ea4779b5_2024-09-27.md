Hey! So, another whirlwind of a day, and I thought I'd share before it all gets buried in my tired brain. You know, just one of those **"Dear diary—today was wild!"** kind of vibes.

So, I kicked off my morning with a walk through the Seoul Forest. It was, like, the epitome of autumnal beauty. Picture this: leaves in an explosion of oranges and reds, a slight chill in the air, and the early morning light just made everything pop. I had my camera with me, snagging a few shots here and there. There’s something about fall mornings that just... invigorates you, right? Almost feels like I'm getting a fresh start every single day.

Oh, and get this—I spotted this adorable old couple doing Tai Chi under a Gingko tree. They looked so at peace and in sync with each other. I couldn’t resist; I had to capture that moment. It’s funny how those candid shots often end up being the most memorable.

Fast forward to the afternoon, and it was time for that art therapy session at the Seoul Senior Center with Haelim Su. Man, what an experience! We had a small yet enthusiastic crowd of elderly participants, all so ready to dive into art and storytelling. There’s something incredibly uplifting about watching someone paint their memories on a canvas. Especially these folks—they’ve got so much lived wisdom, each stroke of their brush tells a lifetime of stories.

JungKyu Won was there too, doing what he does best—mesmerizing everyone with his poetry. One moment, he’s reciting lines that echo the tranquility of the Han River, and the next, he’s diving into the rich history of Gyeongju. His words flowed perfectly with the visual art around us; you could really feel the room coming to life.

I ended up spending a lot of time chatting with this lady, Mrs. Kim. She’s got this incredible life story that she’s turning into a blend of vibrant colors and abstract forms. Her husband used to be in the navy, and she’s now painting scenes from their travels. Each canvas held a story of a different port city they visited. Seriously fascinating stuff.

Oh, by the way, the laughter and energy in the room were infectious. Everyone seemed to forget about any aches or troubles they might have had. At one point, we all started sharing personal anecdotes—like, Haelim was talking about the time she accidentally dyed her hair blue instead of brunette (classic Haelim move!), and that got everyone sharing their own little mishaps and funny moments. It really turned the session into a communal, joyous event.

Before I forget, remember how Chloé was super excited about her vocal practice today? I didn’t catch up with her afterwards, but knowing her and her endless enthusiasm, I'll bet she nailed it! Can’t wait to hear all about how Seohee’s sketches influenced her practice.

Alright, coming back to the art session—it was an eye-opener on so many levels. These elderly folks have these brilliant, untapped reservoirs of creativity. It reminded me why I’m so passionate about mental wellness and the arts. There’s this therapeutic power in expressing yourself, no matter the medium. Plus, it's way more fun sharing your quirks and stories with a bunch of open-hearted people.

Haelim and I wrapped up the day with some coffee and reflection. She’s got these exciting ideas for future sessions—maybe bringing in some virtual reality art tours! That’s a pretty wild concept, right? Imagine our seniors exploring Renaissance Italy or the streets of Paris without ever leaving Seoul. The possibilities are exhilarating.

And oh! I ran into Andrew and JiYong as they were heading to Insadong. They were buzzing with excitement; you know how Andrew gets with his camera. Can’t wait to see what kind of cultural treasures they unearthed. Insadong is always a goldmine for inspiration.

Small update on my own little project—thinking of incorporating those photos from Bukchon Hanok Village into my wellness talks. I feel like they capture the simplicity and historical beauty that can be soothing to our minds. Had a mini-"aha" moment about how to tie it all together while talking to Mrs. Kim today. Isn't it cool how inspiration strikes from the most unexpected conversations?

You know what, amidst all this creativity, there’s also a very grounded sense of community. It’s like, every conversation, every shared smile, every splash of paint on a canvas, weaves us tighter into this beautiful tapestry of life.

Okay, I think I’ve rambled enough for one day. But yeah, can't wait to catch up and hear about your day. What adventures did you get up to? Any fun stuff with the FriYAY Crew? Alright, gotta jot down these thoughts before they slip away. You know how my brain is—a bit like a sieve sometimes.

**I need to get back to work. Catch you later!**
