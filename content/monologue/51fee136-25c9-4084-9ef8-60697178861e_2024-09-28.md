Hey there, it’s Jesse. Just wanted to give you a rundown of today. You know, one of those days that starts off pretty chill and then just kind of blossoms unexpectedly.

So, the morning began in Yeouido Park. It’s been my little sanctuary lately, and today was no exception. The crisp autumn air was just what I needed. I brought my journal and some painting supplies – decided to let the morning sun inspire me. Funny thing, I found this perfect spot under a cluster of maples, which seemed almost too picturesque not to capture. So, I did a quick sketch first and then lost myself in painting for a bit. It was pretty serene; the kind of calm that makes you forget about time. 

And guess what? I ran into Seohee; she was out for a jog and saw me painting. We ended up chatting for a bit about our latest projects. She’s been working on a series of sketches inspired by the city’s architecture. It’s always fascinating to hear her perspective on things. Before she left, she promised to join one of our art therapy sessions soon. I think she’ll bring a great energy to the group.

Oh, by the way, I had a pretty amazing tea and poetry session this afternoon at Bukhansan Forest with Chloé and Seohee again. You know how Chloé’s voice can just fill any space with such a warm, uplifting vibe? Well, today was no different. The way she sings almost makes the leaves dance. It’s the kind of thing that sticks with you for the rest of the day, you know? Seohee was there, capturing everything with her sketches. Her drawings of Chloé singing were simply stunning. It felt like her art added an extra layer of depth to the whole session.

We had some good laughs too, mostly at our own expense. Chloé and I reminisced about our past collaborations. At one point, Seohee made this witty comment about blending art and music, and Chloé just burst out laughing. Moments like these really remind me why we do what we do – it’s all about creating beautiful memories together.

Later in the evening, we headed over to the Han Riverside for an art video shoot. Chloé invited me again, and you know how persuasive she can be. I’m glad I said yes. The sunset was absolutely breathtaking – the sky looked like it had been painted with shades of crimson and gold. Perfect backdrop for a creative experiment. 

We had a small crew and everyone was buzzing with excitement. Chloé’s performance was so captivating, as always, and I managed to help with some behind-the-scenes stuff. Let's just say I’m getting better at handling a camera. JiYong and Andrew showed up too. Andrew’s always a bundle of energy, and he managed to whip out some fantastic storytelling shots for his next podcast.

Oh! I almost forgot. We had this impromptu riverside gathering after the shoot. You know how spontaneous our crew can be. It was like a mini celebration of our creativity. JiYong brought his camera gear and managed to snap some candid shots. Haelim joined us too; she’d just finished a yoga session at the museum courtyard. I swear, that girl is a ball of positive energy.

We all just sat by the water, sharing stories and poetry. It felt really grounding, like something you'd want to bottle up and keep forever. Chloé and Andrew were tossing ideas around for their next projects. It’s such a joy to witness their creative process in real-time.

I even read a piece I’d written earlier that day, inspired by the park. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, which was nice. You know, sometimes you just need that little validation from your friends to push you a bit further.

Looking back, it feels like today was woven with threads of creativity and camaraderie. These moments, they’re the little anchors that keep me balanced. Somehow, amidst all the busy routines and fleeting worries, days like these remind me why I moved here in the first place. It’s about finding beauty in the everyday and sharing it with people who matter.

Anyway, I’m probably rambling now. Just thought you’d like to hear about the highlights. We should catch up in person soon. I’ve got some new ideas brewing for our next art session, and I’d love to get your thoughts.

I need to get back to work. Catch you later.
