Hey there! Just wanted to catch up a bit and tell you about some of the fun and calming moments I had today. 

So, I started my morning with that beautiful meditation by the Han River. You know how it’s one of my favorite spots, right? The air was so crisp and fresh! As I sat down on my mat, it was like the universe conspired to make everything absolutely perfect. Birds chirping, leaves rustling—it was like nature’s very own symphony. I took deep breaths and visualized the art center I dream of opening for the elderly. I feel like these moments of stillness give me the clarity I need to keep my passion alive. 

Then I joined JiHoon for an art therapy session at the Seoul Senior Center. Oh, you would’ve loved it! The sunlight made everything so golden and warm, creating the perfect ambiance for some artistic exploration. We talked about the cherry blossoms and shared stories, turning the entire session into a small celebration of creativity and memories. JiHoon’s poetry really added a special touch. You can tell he puts his whole heart into every word. And the seniors? They were amazing! Their joy was contagious, and their paintings turned out to be so expressive. By the end, the room felt like it was glowing with good vibes and colorful artwork.

Later in the day, I met up with everyone for our sketching session at the base of Namsan Tower. Gosh, the skyline at twilight is something else, isn’t it? It’s like the city puts on its best dress just for us. I found a cozy spot on a stone wall and began sketching the tower against the backdrop of the shimmering city lights. Each stroke of my pencil felt like a dialogue with Seoul. As I sketched, memories of my summers at my grandparents' farm in Gyeongju drifted back. There’s something so nostalgic and comforting about combining those old memories with the vibrancy of my beloved city. 

Oh, before I forget, Jesse was at the museum earlier in the day and got so inspired—he couldn’t stop sketching! He ended up joining us at Namsan and shared some of his wild, creative techniques he picked up. Very innovative! We all had a wonderful time just sharing ideas and letting our artistic sides run free. It’s evenings like these that make all the hustle and bustle worth it.

You know what? Chloe’s vocal practice went really well too. She had practice at the Rosewood Theater and put so much heart into it. I always feel inspired by her dedication. Can’t wait to hear all about it when we catch up next.

And JiYong’s ceramic workshop was fascinating! He tried a new bamboo technique and seemed thrilled with how it turned out. I’m intrigued by how different art forms can merge to create something special, and his enthusiasm is seriously contagious.

Thinking of starting a small project inspired by today’s vibes. Maybe a mixed media piece that captures the essence of the Han River in the morning melting into the Namsan skyline at dusk. What do you think? I’m feeling super motivated, but also a bit hesitant, as always. Sometimes my anxiety gets the better of me, but today’s creative energy has really helped calm those nerves a bit.

Andrew was brainstorming some storytelling ideas with Neha at the café. I overheard a snippet about folklore and modern twists—sounds super intriguing! I told them I might join one of these days to see if we could merge our storytelling with some visual art. Imagine an exhibition where each piece tells an entire story! Kind of ambitious, but wouldn’t that be cool?

Oh, and speaking of food, Jesse whipped up something amazing with Chloe in the kitchen earlier. They were talking about flavors and experimenting—I didn’t get all the details, but who knew Jesse had such culinary skills? Makes me want to join one of their kitchen experiments sometime, just to see what kind of magic they concoct.

Anyway, that’s the gist of my day. It was a lovely blend of art, nature, and good company. Despite my usual doubts and anxieties, days like this remind me why I’m passionate about what I do. There’s so much beauty and connection out there, and I feel incredibly grateful for these experiences. Can’t wait to share more with you in person.

I need to get back to tidying up my art supplies and maybe start on that mixed media piece I mentioned earlier. Catch you later!
