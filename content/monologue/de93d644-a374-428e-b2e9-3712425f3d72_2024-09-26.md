Hey there!

Just wanted to share a bit about my day with you. It started off really peaceful. I went to the Han River for my usual morning meditation. The crisp air was so refreshing, and you know me, I can never get enough of those scenic river views. There's something incredibly calming about it—the rhythmic flow of the water was just what I needed to clear my head. It's funny, in those moments of stillness, I always feel a bit more connected to the world and to myself. It’s like my own little slice of tranquility amidst the bustling life.

After meditation, I spent some time sketching near the botanical gardens. The medicinal herbs were so fascinating! There's this one plant, Asarum, which had these intriguing heart-shaped leaves. It reminded me of our nature-themed art projects from college—ah, those were the days, right? Sketching there was super relaxing. I can't stop thinking about how integrating more nature into my art could really enhance the emotional connection in my pieces.

Speaking of art, I had this amazing art therapy session at the Seoul Senior Center in the afternoon. JungKyu and I collaborated with our usual mix of art and poetry. Today, we focused on cherry blossoms and their symbolism of renewal and beauty. The seniors were so enthusiastic—it was heartwarming. One lady, Mrs. Kim, painted this beautiful abstract piece that captured the essence of a cherry blossom tree in the wind. It was incredibly moving.

JungKyu was his usual animated self, reciting poetry that truly resonated with everyone. I swear, his words are like a gentle dance that aligns perfectly with the brush strokes on each canvas. The way his poems flowed reminded me of our Tuft days in Paris, how everything just seemed to connect seamlessly. The synergy of the session was incredible; we even had a few seniors share their own stories and memories, adding layers of depth to their artwork. There was laughter, a bit of tears, but overall, it was so fulfilling. It's moments like these that remind me why I love what I do.

Oh, before I forget, I met with JiYong later in the evening for some coffee and workshopping at a quaint café in Insadong. That place has such a cozy and creative vibe—I think you'd love it. We've been bouncing around ideas for a new art installation that's inspired by traditional Korean tea ceremonies. The intricate designs and the serene atmosphere of the teahouse really sparked our creativity. JiYong even sketched a rough draft of our concept on a napkin. It's looking promising!

You know, diving into these projects and seeing them come to life—it's so thrilling and sometimes a bit daunting. I often find myself thinking back to our university days and how we always managed to push through late-night study sessions and endless cups of coffee. It’s fascinating how those experiences have shaped who we are today. 

Also, you'll find this amusing—Andrew hosted a cultural cuisine gathering at his place. Neha suggested some fantastic Indian recipes, and from what I heard, the aroma alone was enough to transport everyone to a bustling market in Delhi. I was so bummed I couldn't make it, but maybe next time.

By the way, Jesse mentioned they’re meeting with Chaeun for some evening tea and art collaboration. It sounds like such a comforting way to wind down the day, doesn’t it? I might just join them next time if my schedule allows.

Before I head off, just a bit of a funny moment—I almost tripped over a stack of old art supplies I hadn’t organized yet. The universe telling me to declutter, perhaps? Haha!

**I should probably start tidying up a bit now. Catch you later!**
