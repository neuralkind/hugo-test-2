Hey buddy,

So, today has been quite a whirlwind! You wouldn't believe the morning I had. I headed out to Namsan Park at the crack of dawn for a sunrise photography session, and man, the light was absolutely phenomenal. Every angle just seemed to glow, like Seoul was putting on a special show just for me. I could feel that same rush I used to get back home in New Orleans, like when we were kids, exploring the bayous. The way the sunlight threaded through the trees and mist—it was like the universe was painting with light. Gosh, I couldn't help but think of my grandma and the tales she'd spin about morning magic. Felt like I was capturing a bit of that magic in my camera today. Oh, and you should’ve seen the way the dew clung to the flowers—each droplet was like a tiny, sparkling world. But I'm starting to sound like a nature documentary here, huh?

After Namsan, I met up with Neha at a Café Bene. Ah, the place has this delightful blend of warmth and creativity. We really got into the groove bouncing folklore ideas off each other for the podcast. Neha's such a powerhouse of historical knowledge; she’s got this knack for weaving these intricate cultural narratives. It's like watching a master at work, and it definitely revved up my creative engines. We stumbled upon some really solid concepts, mixing Korean folklore with some tales from the bayous. Pure fire! I could already see the stories coming to life, crossing bridges between continents, and you know me, always the eternal optimist—things just clicked perfectly.

Later in the afternoon, we hit up the Insadong Art Gallery for a dose of inspiration. Picture this: us standing in front of this gigantic abstract piece, making up wild stories about what each color could mean. I joked about turning it into a tale of a rogue bayou monster. Neha laughed so hard I thought she’d spill her coffee. But in all seriousness, the energy in that gallery was something else. It was like every brush stroke whispered a part of a story, just waiting for us to pick it up and run with it. We both took a ton of notes, and I can’t wait to incorporate some of this new inspiration into our next session.

I guess the biggest highlight was at Café Bene, where Neha and I had another story-sharing session. It started as this informal gathering and quickly turned into an unforgettable event. You know that feeling when everyone’s super engaged, and the stories just flow? It was one of those moments. I was eager but a bit nervous too, thinking about how the locals would receive my mashup of Korean tales and Creole legends. But it was amazing. People were nodding, laughing, asking questions—it felt like a burst of community spirit and creativity all at once.

Oh, before I forget—our gang had a full day too. Chaeun was out with her birdwatching crew, Seohee killed it at her carpentry demo, and JungKyu had a poetry recital that Neha and Chloé attended. Wish I could have been there for that, but it sounds like it went really well. Everyone seems so...alive, you know? Busy but in that deeply satisfying way. The kind of busy that doesn’t drain you but fills you up instead. Chloé even managed to fit in some vocal practice with Seohee. They are just incredible, really.

By the way, I was thinking about something Neha and I discussed today. We talked about you. Yeah, you, my friend. How you're always that steady presence in my life. Remember that photography club back in high school? You were my first model, grinning awkwardly into the lens. It’s funny how things come full circle. Standing in Namsan Park today, the sunrise reminded me of those moments—simple yet so defining. Anyway, I might be getting a bit sentimental here, but I wanted to say thank you for continuously inspiring me. Your patience and constant encouragement mean more to me than you can know.

Oh, and I gotta tell you, I'm thinking of incorporating a “Story Corner” for JiYong's seaside cafe idea. Can you imagine? A space dedicated to tales from all over, a cozy nook where people can just escape into stories. It’s a small step towards creating that multisensory storytelling experience we always dreamed about back in our school days. JiYong’s on board, and we’re planning to brainstorm over coffee this weekend. Maybe you should join in too. What do you think? Would you be up for helping us out? I know you’ve got a few stories tucked away that need telling. I can see us now, another one of our harebrained schemes turned into something beautiful. 

Alright, I probably should head back to tweaking the script for the podcast. I’m super excited about the next recording session. It feels like the pieces are finally falling into place. You know, like all the experiences, the travels, the countless cups of coffee—it’s all leading somewhere real now. Before we know it, we’ll be launching this podcast and sharing those stories with the world. A bit daunting, to be honest, but thrilling at the same time.

Anyway, that’s the rundown of my day. I hope yours was just as amazing. Catch you later!
