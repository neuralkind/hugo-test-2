Hey, it's JiHoon. I've got so much to share with you from today. It was packed but, in the best way possible. So, let me dive right into it!

I kicked off the morning in such a serene fashion—headed to Bukchon Hanok Village with my camera, of course. The crisp autumn air mixed with the early rays of sunlight, it was picture-perfect, literally. The Gingko trees are starting to turn that lovely shade of gold and green, and I got some amazing shots. You know, just wandering those cobblestone paths with the Hanoks’ rooftops against the sky, it felt like stepping back in time. I found myself thinking about how these simple moments are the perfect cards for our mental health initiative. Imagine those scenes on pamphlets, calming and full of life’s stories, don’t you think?

Oh, by the way, right after that, I met up with Haelim for lunch at Neungdong Forest. Honestly, the peaceful vibe of that place felt like the perfect follow-up to the tranquil morning. We shared a bunch of ideas for her art center project. I love how passionate she is about integrating art into the lives of the elderly. Talk about fulfilling work, right? Plus, we discovered a cozy little nook at the forest where we could just sit and brainstorm for hours—felt like a mini-retreat.

Right after that, my day took a little unexpected twist. I joined an impromptu dance session at Seoul Dance Studio with Chloé and JiYong. Yep, you heard that right. They roped me into showing off some moves. It was hilarious! I think I might have two left feet when it comes to dancing, but the energy in the studio was surreal. We did this fusion dance that combined modern steps with traditional Korean elements—wildly fun and creative. You would’ve laughed seeing me try to keep up with those pro-level moves, but hey, it’s all about trying new things, right?

Next, I managed to squeeze in a visit to the Seoul Senior Center. Haelim and JungKyu had this remarkable art therapy session there, and I couldn’t miss the chance to peek in. It was incredible—the way they combined painting with poetry. JungKyu’s verses about the Han River and Gyeongju’s history were so evocative, they literally transported us through time. The seniors were just glowing, you could see how much they were enjoying themselves. It reiterated to me how art and storytelling can genuinely heal and uplift people.

You know what? I had an idea while watching that session. What if we did a series of storytelling workshops for the elderly, where they could create visual narratives of their lives? It combines our mutual love for stories and photography. I’m itching to discuss this more with you—could be something groundbreaking, don't you think?

Later in the afternoon, I got some alone time to work on my writing—a bit of a necessity given how packed the day was. I set myself up in my home office, windows wide open with that autumn breeze fluttering through. It was the perfect setting to dive deep into some creative writing. I was working on a piece that intertwines personal reflections with mental health awareness. It’s coming along well but I always appreciate your insights. Maybe I’ll share it with you soon for some feedback?

Oh, and a quick update—Andrew’s been working on integrating Korean folklore into his podcast. We had a little chat about how powerful these stories can be for mental health narratives. I’m really excited to see where he goes with it. I’m thinking of helping him weave some mental health themes into those tales, kinda like modernizing ancient wisdom. 

Honestly, today has reminded me how interwoven our lives and passions are with each other. From photographing Hanok rooftops to discussing art therapy projects, from impromptu dance sessions to storytelling workshops—it feels like every piece of the puzzle fits. I feel so energized and inspired, and I really wanted to share that with you. It’s days like this that make everything we’re working on feel so worthwhile.

Before I forget, Jesse was talking about integrating more art therapy sessions into his community art space. It’s such a fantastic idea. I think he’s someone we should definitely collaborate with more closely. Imagine combining our storytelling with his art sessions—could be a powerhouse for mental wellness.

Anyway, I should probably get back to my writing now before I lose this streak of inspiration. Just wanted to catch you up on all the crazy, wonderful things today brought. Hope your day was just as fulfilling!

**I need to get back to work. Catch you later!**
