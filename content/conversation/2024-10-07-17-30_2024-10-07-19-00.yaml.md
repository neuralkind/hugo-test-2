Li Wei: Ah, Dong-hoon! There you are. I see you've already got your hands on the clay.Dong-hoon Kang: Li! About time you got here. I've been prepping these tools like they're my guitar strings.”Li Wei: I must admit, this is quite different from negotiating business deals.Dong-hoon Kang: Yeah, you can't strategize with clay, Li. But look, I made something that vaguely resembles a cup.Li Wei: Vaguely, indeed. Perhaps it would suit a giant's table.Dong-hoon Kang: Hey, giants need cups too! You should see yours—looks like it wants to be modern art.Li Wei: I suppose it's a reflection of abstract thinking gone awry.Dong-hoon Kang: Don't worry, it shows potential... or at least character. How's it going with that vase you started?Li Wei: I'm trying to see it as a form of meditation, but my hands won't cooperate.Dong-hoon Kang: Soft hands can be a curse. Here, try adding a touch of pressure, like this.Li Wei: You're surprisingly adept at this. All those years with a guitar must have trained your grip.Dong-hoon Kang: Maybe, or I've just got a knack for messes. Figured I'd capitalize on it.Li Wei: I bet your bar could use some hand-crafted mugs. Imagine telling your patrons, 'I made these!'"Dong-hoon Kang: Yeah, and then watching them scrutinize every lopsided flaw!Li Wei: Admit it, you'd love the banter.Dong-hoon Kang: True. I mean, that's kind of the charm, isn't it? Imperfection in art... and life.Li Wei: Since when did you get so philosophical?Dong-hoon Kang: Hanging out with you, Mr. Strategic Thinker. Some of it rubs off, you know.Li Wei: Touché. All right, back to molding this unruly lump. Any advice other than pressure?Dong-hoon Kang: Channel your inner child. Imagine it's playdough. Let go of the perfect form you've conjured in your mind.Li Wei: Easier said than done, but I'll give it a shot.Dong-hoon Kang: That's the spirit. Worst case, we'll call it modern art, remember?Li Wei: I feel like I've heard that before... possibly due to clay regret.Dong-hoon Kang: Every artist, and I use that term loosely, needs a fail-safe line.Li Wei: Case in point: our thriving vases turned misaligned artistry.Dong-hoon Kang: Hey, at least we're consistent! What about your familial zen trips? Does this activity not evoke any countryside nostalgia?Li Wei: Oddly, it does—a certain tranquility, minus my father's judging eye over workmanship.Dong-hoon Kang: The freedom of flawed creation. We're adulting hard today.Li Wei: With airy guidance from someone like Ji-hee, relief washes over the competing perfectionist in me.Dong-hoon Kang: Seems we've entered a Zen state, my friend. One with the clay, one with our scattered existential musings.Li Wei: Scattering indeed... speaking of which, try not to shower me with clay again, maestro.Dong-hoon Kang: I'll make it up with a drink at The Groove. You'll need some jazz to wash off today's artistic endeavors.Li Wei: Jazz and a toast to art's humble meanders. I might take you up on that.Dong-hoon Kang: Deal. And next time, let's switch it up—painting, perhaps?Li Wei: As long as it's not on a pottery wheel, anything goes.Li Wei: As ready as I'll ever be, though I suspect I'll need a lot of guidance from Ji-hee.Dong-hoon Kang: You've got me too. Just remember, clay is like jazz—it's all about feeling.Li Wei: Easy for the musician to say. But I do appreciate this departure from formality.Dong-hoon Kang: Watch out, you might actually start liking it!Li Wei: Highly unlikely. My business brain is still processing the lack of structure.Dong-hoon Kang: Structure-schmucture. Just let go a bit, like handling business with a pinch of flair.Li Wei: Fair point. Do you think I can incorporate a weekly pottery session into my routine?Dong-hoon Kang: Only if you promise to make one less PowerPoint each week.Li Wei: I'll note that in my strategic plan for leisure.Dong-hoon Kang: Strategizing fun—talk about a life hack.Li Wei: It's more torture than a hack, honestly.Dong-hoon Kang: Look at my mug! It’s got two handles now. Functionality wins this time.Li Wei: It looks like a vessel designed for cautious drinkers indeed.Dong-hoon Kang: And it perfectly complements your avant-garde vase.Li Wei: Fascinating interpretation—my vase as salute to nonconformity.Dong-hoon Kang: See? You do get the vibe!Li Wei: Or maybe it's the air in this room. It promotes artistic freedom.Dong-hoon Kang: Freedom and chaos, often closely related.Li Wei: Much like our endeavors today. What’s the purpose of this slip material again?Dong-hoon Kang: Think of it as the glue of creativity—keeps everything in one piece.Li Wei: You're quite the philosopher amidst all this clay.Dong-hoon Kang: Try bashing the clay once—very therapeutic after those emails.Li Wei: I'll consider it, though my computer would disagree.Dong-hoon Kang: Art knows no rivalry—even with tech.Li Wei: If you say so. How's The Groove running these days?Dong-hoon Kang: Ah, expanding and evolving! Hoping to host some pottery exhibitions next.Li Wei: Hope you reserve a wall for modern interpretations of my noble vase.Dong-hoon Kang: Only if my two-handled mug gets front-center stage.Li Wei: Naturally. They’ll make quite the dynamic duo.Dong-hoon Kang: We should hang up our clay tools if that happens.Li Wei: Perhaps focus back on business—less risk of lopsided outcomes.Dong-hoon Kang: Though a corporate world with wagging sculptures entertains the mind.Li Wei: An amusing thought, to say the least. Should we check on Ji-hee's opinion?Dong-hoon Kang: Let's just say a generous splash of creativity there.Li Wei: And another reason to improve our artistic skills.Dong-hoon Kang: Here's to more imperfect mugs and vases!Li Wei: So how's the clay treating you, maestro?Dong-hoon Kang: Honestly? It's putting up a bigger fight than I expected.Li Wei: A worthy adversary—bet it doesn't serenade you back like a crowd at The Groove.Dong-hoon Kang: It's got its own rhythm, softer than applauses but just as demanding.Li Wei: Your mug is evolving nicely. Planning to use it at the bar?Dong-hoon Kang: If it survives! But if not, it'll be a good conversation starter—'This mug led a tough life.'Li Wei: Or a cautionary tale in craftsmanship.Dong-hoon Kang: Let's not invite critics, okay? Your vase could use that mysterious abstract quality.Li Wei: I claim it's minimalist. Less defined, more... interpretive.Dong-hoon Kang: A strategic move, I see. Clay's a bit unpredictable, yet it matches your approach to ambiguity in deals—that flexibility.Li Wei: Except clay isn't too big on mergers.Dong-hoon Kang: True! But hey, Ji-hee approved of my double handles. I'm finally putting function over form.Li Wei: Next stop, ceramics maestro. Watch out, though, pressures your ally and enemy in clay.Dong-hoon Kang: Especially if you want to avoid a squashed mug scenario. Your hands getting a hang of it yet?Li Wei: They're adjusting, albeit precariously—a fine line between focus and relaxation.Dong-hoon Kang: You're getting there. Just remember, small victories.Li Wei: Speaking of small, Ji-hee mentioned our work could star in the upcoming pottery expo.Dong-hoon Kang: You're kidding! Pfft, as the comic relief or... ?Li Wei: Every show needs contrast, right?Dong-hoon Kang: And what better duo than us—'form vs. function,' the clash of titans.Li Wei: We should redesign yet. Leave those delicate designs to the experts.Dong-hoon Kang: But where's the fun in perfection? At the bar, 'people savor the flaws, right?' Li Wei: Certainly a refreshing thought. Perhaps I'll base my next PowerPoint around flawed idealism.Dong-hoon Kang: Innovative! Just ensure it has fewer swirly slides.Li Wei: Noted. Agendas could use a human touch—comes down to art, after all.Dong-hoon Kang: Don't worry, I've got enough swirls going on with clay already.Li Wei: Different medium, same principle.Dong-hoon Kang: Think a pottery wheel beats a VR escape room for inspiration?Li Wei: Certainly engaging, if distracting. Remember our painted drums?Dong-hoon Kang: Oh, those were colorful disasters.Li Wei: Art invites the unexpected. That's why we keep coming back, right?Dong-hoon Kang: And it's cheaper than therapy!Li Wei: Not a bad argument. What else could we experiment with—painting next?Dong-hoon Kang: Painting, sculpture—sky's the limit. How about a themed night at The Groove?Li Wei: Feel free to showcase our clay endeavors. Define avant-garde once more.Dong-hoon Kang: Now you're speaking my language, Li. Let's toast to our creative spirit.
