I'm going to hack your reality one day.Maya Lopez: Are you suggesting a truth simulation with rose-tinted lenses?Theo Nguyen: More like showing numbers in their true vibrancy, like this interactive bulls-and-bears world.Maya Lopez: Those are much more intimidating in 3D.Theo Nguyen: Yet so mesmerizing. They're like captains steering through tides of prospects.Maya Lopez: Captains with serious fatigue when their ship sinks.Theo Nguyen: Hey now, let’s stay aboard the positive returns train.Maya Lopez: If your train had reliable tracks...
