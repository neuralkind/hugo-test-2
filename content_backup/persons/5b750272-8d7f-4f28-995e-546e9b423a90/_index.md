<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Mika Fujimoto, a 17-year-old creative prodigy from Tokyo, possesses a keen interest in blending art and technology. As a student at Station-11, she excels in visual artistry and creating immersive virtual environments. While her creations evoke emotions akin to entering a dream, she occasionally wrestles with glitches and fears losing touch with reality. Compassionate and imaginative, she aspires to push the boundaries of art through technological innovations. Known as "The Visual Dreamer," Mika is distinguished by her petite stature and vibrant appearance. Despite being somewhat sensitive and scattered, she expresses herself profoundly through her art and values connecting with like-minded individuals in the tech-art community.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Mika's early years were filled with vibrant experiences that laid the foundation for her artistic passions. At age 4, her joy was boundless when she painted a rainbow mural on her bedroom wall. This love for art blossomed further during a visit to an art museum with her parents, where she was captivated by giant sculptures. A pivotal moment occurred at age 6, when she first donned a virtual reality headset, giggling with delight. Her talents were formalized at age 7 when she won a school art competition, feeling accomplished. Drawing inspiration from both traditional and digital mediums, by age 9, Mika had begun to merge these worlds in her creations. Encouragement from her family nurtured her reflective journaling, ultimately guiding her through early challenges and triumphs, including her stunning digital debut at age 12.</div><br>

After honing her skills in Tokyo at an art academy, she showcased her virtual installations in New York City, sparking vibrant public discourse. Her journey continued with a residency in Berlin, where European art history expanded her creative narrative. In Reykjavik, Mika sought solitude amidst serene landscapes to infuse nature's tranquility into her work. An inspiring sojourn to Seoul introduced her to cutting-edge VR technologies, fueling new digital endeavors. An ensuing art fellowship in Paris enriched her style with elegance. Returning to Tokyo, she found harmony in balancing cosmopolitan life with personal projects deeply rooted in her artistic origins, defining this new chapter with a profound purpose.</div><br>
