<br>
<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Mia Zhang, a 17-year-old from Modern City, is renowned for her protective energy shield abilities which define her role as ''The Shield'' in her magical community. Rooted in a loving family unaware of her powers, she attends St. Ivy's High School and a secret magic institute. Driven by the desire to ensure the safety of the magical world, Mia practices yoga, calligraphy, and reads fantasy novels to keep herself calm and centered. Known for her selfless and loyal nature, she is deeply committed to her friends. However, she struggles with anxiety and fears letting her friends down, often neglecting her own needs. </div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Mia's earliest memories are filled with joyful family celebrations, such as her first birthday and playing in the autumn leaves. Her fascination with magic began at a young age, amplified by reading her first fantasy book at five. Two years later, she began practicing yoga with her mother, enjoying peaceful afternoons in harmony. Her pivotal memory occurred at twelve when she first discovered her energy shield powers during a science class, leaving her shocked yet thrilled. Shortly after, Mia encountered the secret entrance to a magical institute, which became a transformative experience. As she learned to harness her powers, she demonstrated heroism by saving a classmate during a magical accident at age fourteen, further solidifying her aspirations toward shielding and protection.

<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">As Mia matured, her magical journey intensified. At twenty, she was accepted into the Mystic Valley Magic Academy, where advanced training honed her skills alongside peer friendships. Her adventure led her to The Enchanted Isles, an expedition that deepened her bonds and reinforced her role as 'The Shield'. Back home, she assumed a guardianship role with a network dedicated to maintaining magical harmony, experiencing both pressure and purpose. Seeking respite, Mia retreated to a Secluded Mountain Retreat, engaging in mindful practices. At twenty-five, she explored Haunted Whisper Woods, contributing to both research and security. The following year, she spearheaded a mission to the Hidden Caves of Amity, establishing a refuge for displaced magical creatures, witnessing the power of collective action and inspiring a profound impact within the magical realm.
