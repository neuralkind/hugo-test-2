<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Victor Chan is a passionate and intelligent 29-year-old indie game developer based in San Francisco. Standing at an athletic 174 cm tall, he presents himself in casual-gamer attire, reflecting his interests in gaming, photography, and sci-fi movies. An American of Asian descent, Victor's agnostic beliefs allow him to maintain an open mind, as represented by his high score in openness on the Big Five personality scale. Known for his storytelling and coding talents, Victor dreams of launching a successful indie game, although he struggles with social interactions. Despite occasional imposter syndrome, he maintains a hopeful outlook, drawing strength from his tight-knit professional network and engaging in activities like meditation to manage his anxieties.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Victor's childhood memories are filled with moments of joy, curiosity, and achievement. Growing up in Los Angeles, he cooed contentedly in his family's cozy home and giggled while spilling cereal in their kitchen. A pivotal moment at age four was watching Star Wars for the first time, which sparked a lifelong fascination with sci-fi. With a strong sibling bond, he felt proud building block towers with his sister and creating paper rockets with his father. A natural storyteller, he won first place in a school storytelling contest at age seven. His techno-savvy roots were established early on, as demonstrated by his delight in coding camps and immense pride when building his first robot and assembling his first computer at ages 11 and 12, respectively. These formative experiences fueled his passion for technology and creativity.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">Venturing into the professional sphere, Victor gained invaluable industry experience during a college internship in LA, which fostered a sense of belonging. Further honing his craft, he relocated to San Francisco for graduate studies, where he thrived amidst a vibrant gaming community. Victor ventured to Tokyo on a work exchange, immersing himself in the cultural richness and diversity of Japanese gaming, which broadened his perspective. Upon returning stateside, he co-founded an indie studio in Austin, reveling in the creative challenges and collaboration there. Now back in San Francisco, Victor is on the cusp of releasing a breakthrough indie game, fueled by the city's dynamic tech culture. This promising phase is characterized by both creative satisfaction and the inevitable pressures of high expectations, yet the serene reminders of sunsets encapsulate his belief in staying true to his path. </div><br>
