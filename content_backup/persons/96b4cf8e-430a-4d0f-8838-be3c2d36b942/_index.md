<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Sora Nakamura, a 17-year-old Japanese student at Station-11, blends creativity with a quiet introspection. Nicknamed "The Quiet Maestro," he skillfully manipulates soundscapes to evoke a full range of emotions, remaining deeply drawn to crafting new auditory realities within "The Horizon," a virtual sound experience. Sora is a creative genius with a high degree of empathy and openness, yet struggles with interpersonal communication and fears misunderstanding. Embracing his Buddhist beliefs and grounded by family, especially inspired by his grandfather, a renowned music conductor, Sora's talents include sound manipulation and virtual reality design, which are celebrated both academically and creatively.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Sora's formative years were tightly interwoven with music and sound. From his infancy, where melodies from mobiles pleased him, to learning how sounds can evoke feelings on his xylophone at age four, Sora's relationship with sound was innate. Winning a school music competition at age five fostered a sense of pride, deepened by the musical bond he shared with his grandfather. As he encountered urban soundscapes upon moving to Tokyo at age ten, Sora's passion shifted towards creating these as unique sonic experiences, culminating in an international sound design victory. These early experiences helped sharpen his auditory senses, consistently molding him into a creative force adept at weaving moods with melodies.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">In recent years, Sora Nakamura's sonic journey traversed various cultures and landscapes. A yearlong immersion in electronic music within Berlin invigorated him, while the tranquility of Kyoto's Zen gardens provided reflection. His innovative spirit was further fueled by a collaborative tech stint in San Francisco, succeeding a sound exploration venture in Iceland. This exploration allowed him to fuse nature's sounds into compositions that received international acclaim. An interactive Amsterdam exhibition merged visual and auditory art, fulfilling Sora's artistic ambitions. Seoul's academic environment reignited a passion for sound therapy, enriching his outlook, while a return to Hokkaido rekindled familial bonds and rooted his sense of belonging.</div><br>
