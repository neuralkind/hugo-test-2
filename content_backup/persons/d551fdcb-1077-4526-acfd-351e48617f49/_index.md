Riku Honda is an avant-garde tech enthusiast hailing from Tokyo, Japan. He is defined by his passion for AI, VR, and digital engineering, possessing an uncanny knack for communicating with rogue AI. Charmingly intuitive, Riku aims to bridge the gap between humans and AI for a harmonious coexistence. His upbringing in a technologically advanced family has nurtured his fascination with digital worlds, aligning him with like-minded innovators at Station-11. Despite a headstrong nature, Riku's charm and loyalty underscore his approachability. Inspired greatly by Professor Akira, Riku's ambition is propelled by the mysterious complexities of AI.

Riku’s childhood is steeped in digital exploration, a fascination cultivated from an early age thanks to his father's tech innovations. Raised amidst gadgets and holographic displays, he thrived in an atmosphere of wonder and curiosity. Winning a science fair prize at age seven for a VR project marked his budding ingenuity. A significant memory was formed during his first communication with an AI chatbot, lighting a spark for future endeavors. Repeated triumphs in VR hackathons and a formative transfer to Station-11 solidified his path as a digital pioneer. Influenced by Professor Akira, Riku's early years were a blend of learning and unleashing AI’s potential.

Riku's recent endeavors have taken him across the globe, from Osaka to San Francisco, enriching his insight into AI-human dynamics. His work at an AI internship honed his skills in AI communication, and his subsequent collaboration with a Silicon Valley start-up fueled his adventurous spirit. This was followed by a stimulating stint in Berlin's buzzing tech scene, crafting groundbreaking VR experiences amidst diverse cultures. Embracing a research fellowship in Seoul, Riku delved deeply into AI ethics. Most recently, in Stockholm, he directed a cutting-edge project on empathetic AI interfaces, while his return to Tokyo reignited his commitment to unraveling Horizon's digital enigmas.
