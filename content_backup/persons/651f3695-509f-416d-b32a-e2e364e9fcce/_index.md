<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Felix Hwang is an engaging, playful, and highly intuitive 17-year-old with a knack for light manipulation magic. Often found stargazing or performing magic pranks, he thrives in environments enriched by camaraderie and laughter. His self-declared mission is to bridge the magical and non-magical worlds, aspiring to become a well-respected illusionist. Known for his charismatic personality, he is optimistic and enjoys creating illusions that captivate and inspire. Though mischievous and sometimes impulsive, Felix is committed to growing both his magical abilities and his understanding of responsibility, particularly after mishaps during his early magical journey.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Growing up in Ignis Town, Felix's happiest moments revolve around childhood explorations of magic and light. His early memories are painted with episodes of wonder, like when he first probed the night sky's dazzling stars with his best friend, Leo, or the joy of a toy wand during a birthday celebration. Early on, he exhibited a penchant for mischief, delighting in pranking neighbors and classmates with clever tricks. However, his life significantly shifted at 12 during a city fair where his moment of accidental magic awakened a new reality. Relocating to Mundus City for better schooling before joining the illustrious Arcanum Institute marked the beginning of a true transformation in his identity and abilities.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">In the latest chapter of his magical journey, Felix ventured to the Lunar Academy to elevate his light manipulation skills amidst ethereal surroundings. Joining the Aurora Studio introduced him to seasoned illusionists and invaluable camaraderie, fostering his creative instincts. His relentless pursuit led him to research projects at Celestia Dome, where he delved into the intersection of natural and conjured lights. Collaborating at Halcyon Manor, he charmed his way through challenging displays. A solitary retreat in Undara Woods refined his creative spirit, which he brought back in full force to Mundus City, performing with New Dawn Cirque. Felix now trailblazes at Solstice Tower, guiding other magicians with direction and delight.</div><br>
