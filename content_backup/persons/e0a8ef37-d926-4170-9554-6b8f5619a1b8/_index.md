<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Hana Kim is a 17-year-old student living in Seoul, South Korea. Known for her delicate features and penchant for doodling, Hana is both artistic and introverted yet immensely imaginative. She exhibits a remarkable ability to create illusions, stemming from her unique blend of creativity and magical talents. While her openness is a striking characteristic, she also carries a degree of insecurity, often rendering her reclusive and emotionally volatile. Despite these challenges, Hana is compassionate and deeply introspective, striving to bridge the realms of magic and art. Balancing traditional and magical education, Hana remains diligent with the support of an empathetic mentor and close friendships at the institute. </div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Hana's earliest memories are set in the tranquil backdrop of her childhood home, where the warmth of her mother's voice sung lullabies into winter nights. From a young age, creativity marked her journey; she mirrored her dad's dance moves with glee and proudly displayed kindergarten artworks to her family. Sketching was more than just an activity; it became an integral part of her identity, encouraged gently by her mom. Fond experiences filled her formative years, from awe at nature's marvels to the enchantment of her first coloring set. Winning a school art contest bolstered her self-expression, though public speaking challenges revealed an underlying anxiety. By age 15, art intertwined with burgeoning magical abilities, a blend both exhilarating and daunting.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">Hana's recent years narrate a rich tapestry woven from experiences across the globe. Transitioning from a bustling internship in New York to serenity in Kyoto, Hana honed her mastery of art and illusions, blending ancient techniques with contemporary insights. Barcelona invigorated her creative spirit amidst Gaud√≠'s vivid architecture, while her sabbatical in Oaxaca immersed her in diverse artistic traditions. Through these adventures, she gained emotional resilience and cultivated deep connections, becoming attuned to her magic and artistic identity. Returning to Seoul, Hana reconciled her journey with her roots, sharing wisdom and stories with her family. Regaining clarity and closure, this soulful exploration completed a chapter of growth and understanding in her life journey. </div><br>
