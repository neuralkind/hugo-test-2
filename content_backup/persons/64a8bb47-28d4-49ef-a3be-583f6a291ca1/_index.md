<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Felix Hwang, a charismatic, humorous, and creative Korean-American, resides in Orchid City while pursuing an Electrical Engineering major. With adept skills in light manipulation, he dabbles in electronics and magic tricks, thriving on bringing joy through illusions. Despite his laid-back nature and humorous disposition, Felix struggles with procrastination and a tendency to avoid responsibility. His eclectic interests span video games, snowboarding, and photography, influenced by repeated relocations during childhood. His defining ability—light manipulation—turns him into a trickster, often creating a lively atmosphere around the Crescent Institute, where he's well-known for his lively performances. Felix's persona strikes a delicate balance between a carefree attitude and an unyielding passion for magic and creativity.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">From an early age, Felix showed a fascination with the world around him, fueled by frequent moves due to his mother's job. A memorable childhood event was when Felix first witnessed fireworks on a rooftop, kindling a lifelong enchantment with light. With early interests cemented by a toy electronics set, his path was further shaped by his growing skill in performing simple light shows that entertained his sister. Memories of moving cities evoke feelings of sadness intertwined with the excitement of new adventures and friendships formed through shared love for video games. Felix's perseverance shone through during significant moments like mastering light manipulation at a Valentine's Day dance and joining a photography club, capturing life's beauty through his lens.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">Felix's recent years have been a whirlwind of pursuits and growth. Time at Crescent Institute further honed his skills while simmering his awareness of a dual life filled with both magic's exhilaration and its perils, particularly as he experienced increased magical incidents. His journey extended to Seoul, where an internship blended technology and magic, and he absorbed fresh ideas. Felix returned to his roots in San Francisco, reconnecting with family and grounding himself. An adventurous stint in Aspen indulged his passions for snowboarding and photography, offering him time for reflection and creative exploration. As of late, a European escapade expanded his cultural horizons, offering enriching experiences and deepening his understanding of personal identity and artistic expression, fortifying a globally-inspired approach to his craft.</div><br>
