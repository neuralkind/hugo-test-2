<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Selene White, often called "Lena," is a 17-year-old magical apprentice and high school student. Raised in a mysterious and magical environment, she is juggling her life between a secret magical institute and a regular school. Marked by a slim figure, pale skin, and haunting gaze, her introspective nature is both her strength and burden. She possesses the power to manipulate memories, which allows her to delve into the minds of others but risks losing herself in the process. Her personality is defined by cautious curiosity, empathy, and a deep-seated fear of being exposed as a magical being. Selene is deeply introspective, often finding solace in artistic expressions and ancient texts, yet she remains guarded, wary of letting others into her world. Despite her melancholic aura, Selene strives to find balance and purpose through reflection and self-growth, hoping to master her talents while maintaining her identity.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Selene's childhood intertwined with mysterious elements, with her earliest recollection being the soothing lullabies as she lay in her cradle. Her life has been punctuated by discovering her special abilities and the enigmatic figures that influenced her path. Despite the joy of discovering magical elements, she frequently grapples with unclear memories, likely altered by her own abilities. Moreover, attending her first summer camp, encountering butterflies on the meadows, and the formidable realization of magical identity had significant emotional impact. Her family secrets, whispered under the cover of night, roused early feelings of mystery and intrigue. The clandestine whispers of her grandmother and the awe of witnessing inexplicable magical events shaped her childhood. Frequently overlooked by her peers, she found refuge in sketching during her formative years, slowly becoming aware of her distinctiveness and potential contributions to the magical world.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">Following her education at the magical institute, Selene sought further knowledge and personal growth across various global experiences. Among dark gothic architecture in Edinburgh, she introspected during calm moonlit walks, embracing the merging of art and memory. She visited Kyoto, immersing herself in meditative retreats and Zen philosophies, which are instrumental in enhancing her magical faculties through mindfulness and spiritual clarity. In Turkey, the vibrant colors and historical aura infused Selene with creativity, while in Boston, intense magical training honed her skills alongside tranquil reflections by the harbor. In Iceland, the captivating Northern Lights complemented her self-reflection, intertwined with Norse mythology. Finally, Selene curated a Parisian art exhibition, blending magical and mundane elements, concealing yet celebrating her mystical identity. Throughout these dynamic adventures, she absorbed both cultural richness and self-discovery, integrating ancient philosophies with contemporary mysticism in an inspiring voyage of self-realization.</div><br>
