<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Leila Santos, a 21-year-old Brazilian student, is a thoughtful and strategic individual, known for her quiet nature and remarkable skill in time manipulation. Residing in São Paulo, she's deeply committed to bridging the world of magic with everyday society. Leila is characterized by her calm mentality under pressure, openness to new experiences, and a love for strategy games and sci-fi novels. Despite being occasionally overly cautious and skeptical, she consistently works towards mastering her unique abilities, often journaling about her encounters and strategies. Her close friendships include peers from the Crescent Institute, where she delves deeper into exploring the nuances of time manipulation, guided by her mentor, Agatha.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">Leila's early life was shaped by vivid memories and encounters which kindled her fascination with time. At a young age, her mother's lullabies brought a sense of peace, and moments like unwrapping Christmas presents with her father ignited her sense of wonder. She often reminisced about weekends spent on the beach in her childhood home, envisioning controlling the tides. A pivotal moment was observing a magician, sparking curiosity about time and magic. Her talent for strategy emerged early, notably winning her first chess game at seven. These experiences laid a foundation for her later discovery of her time power at 16, following a slip on ice, marking the beginning of her magical journey.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">In the recent past, Leila has intensely focused on her studies in Applied Physics at São Paulo University, furthering her grasp on time manipulation. Utilizing her analytical skills, she ventured into a tech internship in Curitiba, excelling in temporal technology projects. This experience expanded her understanding of linking magic with technology. Additionally, an exchange program in Salvador allowed her to explore magical time dynamics alongside experts. Presenting theories at a temporal symposium in Marseille further bolstered her reputation. Currently, back in São Paulo, she's engaged in research on integrating magical elements with traditional theory while maintaining her familiar routine as a barista, deepening her connections within magical circles.</div><br>
