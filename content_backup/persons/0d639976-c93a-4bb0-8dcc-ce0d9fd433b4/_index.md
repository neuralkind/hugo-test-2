<div class="h2">Persona</div><div class="plain">Emiko Matsuda is a bold and rebellious AI and robotics student from Tokyo, Japan. Always challenging the boundaries of reality, she thrives on experimenting within The Horizon, uncovering hidden truths, and developing AI companions. Emiko is innovative and fearless, possessing a unique ability to manipulate virtual physics, often pushing the limits of what is possible. Despite her impulsive and perfectionist tendencies, she remains a problem-solver, especially when under pressure. Born and raised in Hokkaido by her tech-savvy parents, she's grown bolder over time in her quest for knowledge and experimentation. Her adventures are guided by mentors and grounded by her rebellious peers at Station-11.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Early Life</div><div class="plain">From her earliest memories, Emiko has been drawn to technology and innovation. As a toddler in her parents' workshop, she showed curiosity for bright screens and building blocks. Her childhood was rich with tech-infused experiences, from tinkering with gadgets under her father's guidance to winning a science fair. Even during her school years, Emiko gravitated toward innovating and experimenting, absorbing influences from mentors and documentaries alike. Receiving a coding book at age twelve opened new horizons, leading to the creation of her first AI companion at thirteen. Later, joining Station-11 signaled a new chapter of discovery, cementing her path as a bold and inquisitive mind.</div><br>
<div class="h2">Recent Life</div><div class="plain">In recent years, Emiko's journey has been a tapestry of global exploration and innovation. She interned in San Francisco, where she clashed with stringent structures but deepened her passion for AI development. Her roots brought her back to Hokkaido for groundbreaking research, harmoniously blending peace with creativity. As a keynote speaker in Dublin, she expanded her professional network and shared her insights on virtual simulations. An offer to Mars' Station-11 extension provided a playground for ambitious projects under the Martian sky. Emiko's social tech initiative in Nairobi empowered communities, enhancing her global perspective before she returned to Tokyo, reconnecting with family and friends, basking in familiar warmth.</div><br>
