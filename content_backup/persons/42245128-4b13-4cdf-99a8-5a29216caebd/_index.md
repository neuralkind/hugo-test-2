Jasmine's early memories reflect a childhood replete with warmth, creativity, and the beginnings of her passion for film. Born in San Francisco, her tender years were marked by the loss of her mother at age eight, leading her to find comfort in films shared with her father. Early in life, she was fascinated by visualsâ€”tuning into colorful TV shapes and capturing her surroundings with a toy camera ignited her love for imagery. Her defining childhood moments included visits to film sets and winning a school photo contest, reinforcing her passion for storytelling. Receiving film editing software as a birthday gift at fourteen and attending indie film festivals further opened her world to cinematic possibilities, setting the foundation for a future in filmmaking.

Her formative college years at UCLA were a fertile period for mastering film editing and nurturing friendships within the creative community. Further explorations in Seoul deepened her documentary work while reconnecting with her Korean heritage. As part of an indie film company in New York City, Jasmine's skills flourished amidst the bustling energy and cultural richness. The plots of her life were marked by fruitful engagements in Vancouver's vibrant festival circuit and an enlightening film editing workshop in Seattle. Each experience enriched her narratives, empowering her storytelling prowess, and preparing Jasmine for upcoming creative ventures with sharpened and diversified perspectives, solidifying her place in the indie film ecosystem.
