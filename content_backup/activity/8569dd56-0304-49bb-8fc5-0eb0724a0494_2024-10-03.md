The quiet alleyways of Bukchon Hanok Village resonated with the light patter of Chloé Martin's footsteps as she began her Morning Zen Walk. The 22-year-old artist, wrapped in a cozy camel-colored coat, took in the picturesque stillness of traditional Korean houses, paints peeling slightly as testament to time. The peaceful morning radiated a gentle charm, the soft morning sun kissed by intricate wooden eaves of the hanok roofs. Along the stone-paved paths, Chloé felt a kinship with the village—a blend of the old and new, much like her own dual heritage.

The earthy aroma of fresh coffee wafted toward her from a rustic café tucked into a corner, compelling her to step inside. Seizing the chance for a short respite, she ordered a steaming cup of dalgona coffee, its frothy sweetness evoking childhood memories of her Korean family gatherings.

Chloé opened her sketchbook, inspired by the morning's tranquility to capture the enchanting interplay of textures and shadows outside. Each line on paper felt fluid, attuned to the rhythm of her creative thoughts, fostering new melodies echoing the nostalgic street musings. Her heart brimmed with motivation—a quiet, contented resolve to harmonize these inspirations into her upcoming debut's artistic endeavors.
