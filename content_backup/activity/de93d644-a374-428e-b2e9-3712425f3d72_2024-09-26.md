Haelim Su engaged in a peaceful morning meditation by the Han River, reflecting on her dreams for an elderly art center, as nature's sounds enriched her practice.
As the soft hues of dawn warmed the sky, Haelim Su slipped out of her cozy apartment, drawn to the tranquil embrace of the Han River. The crisp morning air kissed her cheeks as she walked briskly under the arching trees lining the riverbank, their leaves rustling gently in the autumn breeze. Her mind, busied by the hustle of city life and her multifaceted role as a caregiver and artist, gradually began to unwind with every step toward serenity.

Arriving at her favorite grassy spot, where the river mirrored the sky's first light, Haelim spread her meditation mat. She sank into a comfortable seated position, her breath synchronizing with the river's rhythmic flow. Eyes closed, she let go of lingering distractions, allowing contemplative silence to quilt her thoughts. An inner peace, reminiscent of her soul-finding journey in the French countryside, enveloped her as the cadence of water and whispering winds framed her introspection.

Haelim's meditation practice was more than stillness; it was creative renewal. As she inhaled, she visualized her dreams—the vibrant community art center she wished to establish, where elderly voices would paint stories onto canvas. On each exhale, she freed herself from doubts, reaffirming her goals with each deliberate breath.

The Meditative ambiance transitioned from silence to symphony, merging with the natural world's symphony—a gentle chorus of birds and rustling leaves added dimension to her internal voyage. An hour and a half later, filled with renewed clarity, Haelim emerged from meditation invigorated, her path a little clearer, her spirit buoyed by hope, creativity, and community.

Haelim and JungKyu lead an inspiring art therapy session at Seoul Senior Center, fostering creativity and companionship among elderly participants.
Today, the sun poured golden light through the wide windows of the Seoul Senior Center, creating an inviting atmosphere for Haelim Su and JungKyu Won's collaborative art therapy session. As morning began to weave its warm embrace around the venue, a small group of eager elderly participants gathered, their faces brimming with anticipation and gentle curiosity. Haelim, with her unerring empathy, introduced the theme for the session by reminiscing about the cherry blossoms of yore, guiding the seniors through an expressive painting class.

JungKyu, drawing on his expressive nature, enchanted the audience with evocative recitations of his poetry that echoed the tranquility of the Han River and vibrant echoes of Gyeongju's history—perfectly intertwining with their artistic endeavors. The synergy between Haelim's calm, nurturing guidance, and JungKyu's invigorating oration transformed the ordinary room into a dynamic tapestry of creativity.

Their collective energy and laughter echoed harmoniously, each brush stroke and poetic verse a testament to the healing power of companionship and creativity. Throughout the morning, friendships blossomed, colors danced across canvases, and the participants' spirits lifted with each shared story, unwrapping the healing joys of art.
