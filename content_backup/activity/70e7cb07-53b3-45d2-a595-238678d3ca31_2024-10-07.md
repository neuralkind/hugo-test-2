As the aftermath of yesterday's creative pursuits lingers, Ga-young finds herself enveloped in a delicate aura of anticipation. Today marks her journey into the Seoul Light Museum, where an interactive light art exhibit promises an experience both ethereal and enlightening. As she steps into the cavernous gallery, an immersive tapestry of luminescent hues unfolds before her.
