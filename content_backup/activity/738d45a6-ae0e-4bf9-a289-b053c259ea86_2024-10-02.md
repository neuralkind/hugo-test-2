Steven Thompson and Charles Kelly attend a tea tasting workshop at Elysian Tea House, exploring diverse aromatic teas and strengthening their friendship.
Steven Thompson invited Charles Kelly
Steven Thompson and Charles Kelly arrive at the Elysian Tea House nestled in the heart of Los Angeles. The mid-morning sun bathes the tea shop in a soft glow as the duo steps inside, greeted by the welcoming fragrance of steeped leaves. It's more than just a tea tasting; it's an intimate, sensory journey that invites patrons to explore new aromatic experiences.

The table is adorned with exotic teapots and small plates of delicate pairings, each designed to complement the nuances of the tea selections. As they settle into plush chairs, the tea master's voice flows like a gentle brook, guiding them through the history behind each brew, from the grassy notes of a first-flush Darjeeling to the floral whispers of a jasmine-infused oolong.

Charles, with his mathematical precision, relishes in recording observations, jotting down every flavor profile and aroma onto a notepad. His inquisitive nature prompts conversations with other attendees, drawing parallels between the complexity of flavors and his jazz compositions.

Meanwhile, Steven immerses himself in the narrative, sketchbook in hand, translating the textures and colors of the teas and snacks into art. Laughter bubbles between them as they debate the merits of a peaty Lapsang Souchong over a buttery hojicha.

Their camaraderie is infectious, complemented by moments of introspective silence as the tea ignites shared memories and future possibilities. Together, they savor each sip, swapping stories with newfound friends and weaving a tapestry of connection as rich as the tea they enjoy.

As the session draws to a close, both feel enriched—not only by the diverse teas but by the reinvigorated bond of friendship nurtured over this aromatic exploration.

On this sunlit October afternoon, Steven Thompson finds himself at the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook, poised to embark on a solo photography walk. The air is crisp and filled with the warm glow of early autumn. Despite the cityscape's bustling rhythm below, the hillside is a haven of organic textures and colors, offering a serene canvas for his creativity.

Stepping onto the trail, Steven is greeted by the crunch of leaves underfoot, the soil rich beneath his feet, prompting reflections of past explorations and victories in storytelling and artistic expression. His camera, an old friend, rests comfortably in his hands, responding to the rhythm of his heart.

He pauses to capture the golden cascade of sunlight filtering through oak branches, a playful dance of light and shadow spilling across the path. Birds flit through the canopy, their calls mingling with the distant hum of the city, composing a symphony that both calms and inspires.

With each click of the shutter, Steven frames moments of stillness and movement: the graceful arc of a bird wing, the unexpected charm in the silhouette of a lone plant against the expansive skyline. Each image tells a story, connecting him back to his love for narrative and exploration, cultivated in recent wanderings and past ventures.

As the walk draws to a close, Steven basks in the fulfillment of channeling his solitary creativity into something tangible, the gentle satisfaction washing over him as the sun dips toward the horizon. Today’s journey adds yet another layer to his ever-evolving relationship with the world, a tapestry woven with words, images, and quiet contemplation.
