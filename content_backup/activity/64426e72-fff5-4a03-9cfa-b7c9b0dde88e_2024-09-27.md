Seohee embarks on a solo, artistic retreat at Han River Park, sketching serene landscapes to rejuvenate her creative spirit. A tranquil afternoon marked by nature-inspired creativity and reflection.
As the midday sun casts a gentle warmth over Seoul, Seohee parks her bicycle at Han River Park, her heart fluttering with anticipation for this long-awaited artistic escape. The air is crisp, tinged with the earthy scent of autumn leaves, and the river's flow whispers like an endless muse. Seohee finds a secluded spot overlooking the serene waters, unfurling her sketchbook with a ritualistic reverence.

With a deep breath, she allows the ambient sounds to become her soundtrack- the distant laughter of children playing, the rhythmic pedal of cyclists on the trail, and the soft hum of the city just beyond view. Each element transforms into a brushstroke as she captures the grace of swaying willow trees and the intricate dance of shadows cast by fluffy clouds.

Seohee's hands move fluidly, channeling both precision and intuition into each line and shade. Memories of her Aunt's studio echo in her mind as she expertly captures the textures and details of her surroundings, a testament to years nurtured amidst a palette of inspiration. Her sketches are more than recreations of the landscape; they are visual poems paying homage to her journey.

This retreat is not just about art; it's a vivid meditation, a gentle reawakening of her tangled layers of creativity after days entwined with routines at the dental clinic. As the sun dips toward the horizon, painting the sky in hues of coral and soft lavender, Seohee closes her sketchbook, feeling the calm embrace of fulfillment. She stands, taking one last lingering view of the rippling waters, grateful for this afternoon of soul-nourishing solitude.
