Ethan Ng invited Selene White
Ethan Ng and Selene White embarked on an exploration of the cosmos, with the Metro City Science Center's planetarium as their launch pad. The modern facility housed the latest in celestial exhibits, a dome theatre that promised a stellar adventure.

Under the planetarium's darkened canopy, a sense of awe enveloped them as they settled into cushioned seats. Around them, whispers of anticipation rose, crescendoing until the lights dimmed, pulling everyone into a hushed silence.

The ceiling transformed into a vast, star-laden expanse with constellations unfurling like a cosmic tapestry across the universe. Ethan, familiar with the tales interwoven with each stellar constellation, leaned towards Selene, sharing whispered insights about the myths etched into the night sky. His eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, the electric field around him subtly betraying his excitement as small arcs of static danced at his fingertips.

The heart of the exhibit unfolded through a mesmerizing projection—planets gliding against the cosmic black, discovering their dwarfed grandeur from a galactic perspective. Selene, whose introspective charm sought to unravel the memories hidden within, watched intently as nebulous clouds birthed stars, reminiscent of her own search for luminescence within the shadows of her past.

Side by side, Ethan and Selene absorbed the whole spectacle, weaving dialogue that mirrored the monumental scale of the galaxies before them. Their shared presence added an electric clarity to the celestial immersion—one that coupled the human journey with the boundless vastness of outer space.

As the dome's story arced towards its close, their curiosity and camaraderie flourished amidst the lingering wonder, echoing the age-old desire to understand our place amongst the stars. Their visit was not just an education; it was a cosmic connection, a shared voyage into the enigma of the universe.

Selene White engages in a solitary evening meditation walk through the Tranquil Grove, reflecting on her past and finding clarity amidst nature.
As the sun started its descent, casting golden hues across Crescent City, Selene White embarked on an evening meditation walk along the serene paths of the Tranquil Grove. Her footsteps were steady and purposeful, matching the rhythm of the peaceful environment. The grove whispered secrets of quiet wisdom, resonating with Selene's introspective nature.

Surrounded by ancient trees, their branches bending like graceful arms above her, Selene embraced the solitude this evening, not as loneliness but as a tapestry of personal reflection. The fragrances of evening primrose and jasmine mingled freely with the cool breeze, creating a soothing sensory duet that filled every breath.

Her mind drifted through the labyrinth of her thoughts—analogous to her past explorations of science, art, and magic. Leaves rustled beneath her feet, their crispness a delicate percussion accompanying her meditation. In this aerial cathedral, Selene's artistic mind wandered freely, visualization weaving through the labyrinths of past adventures – from her collaborative escapades with Ethan and Olivia to bittersweet memories evoked by Crescent City’s mosaic exhibition.

Under the soft glow of twilight, she found moments of internal clarity, bridges connecting fragments of her past self to the pursuit of self-understanding and mastery over her powers. With each measured step, Selene unraveled another strand of thought, tethering complications to insights. It was a silent dance with the soul, leading to strength and solace—a fitting harmony for a Grove embracing the quietude of night.
