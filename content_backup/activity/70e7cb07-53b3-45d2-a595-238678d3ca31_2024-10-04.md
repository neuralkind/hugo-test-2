Dong-hoon and Ga-young enjoy a wine tasting at the Urban Vineyard, exploring diverse flavors and reminiscing about their shared creative history.
Dong-hoon Kang invited Ga-young Im
As the clock chimes six in the heart of Seoul, Dong-hoon, with his usual affable smile, greets his friend Ga-young with a warm embrace at the Urban Vineyard. This evening, the Vineyard stands tall like an oasis amidst the bustling city life, its interior adorned with elegantly displayed wines and soft lighting casting a golden hue on the intimate gathering. Dong-hoon, ever the engaging host, guides her through a labyrinth of flavors, sharing anecdotes of why each wine had been selected for tonight's tasting event.

The vineyard's sommelier, a charismatic expert, animatedly explains the subtleties behind the craftsmanship of each wine, enchanting the small group with tales of vineyards from the corners of Korea and beyond. As they sample a pale rosé tinged with subtle hints of cherry, Ga-young humorously chortles at her attempts to distinguish this vintage from the previous one, using imagery reminiscent of her art to describe the unique taste lingering on her palate.

Their jovial conversations weave seamlessly between nods to the past, nostalgic reflections to Ga-young's vivid depictions of their shared history in Busan, and discussions of their creative deliberations. Each sip ignites fervent discussions, every tasting note a nod to their imaginative pursuits, with Dong-hoon likening the smooth textures to guitar riffs he's penned and Ga-young visualizing them as vivid panels from her sketches.

The evening crescendoes with laughter and a deepening bond of friendship as another bottle is uncorked and the hours slip joyfully away. As the city hums around them, Dong-hoon and Ga-young relish the quiet camaraderie of the vineyard's embrace, coloring their evening with vibrant echoes of the past and dreams of future collaborations.

Ga-young embraces a peaceful morning ritual, practicing yoga by the Han River as the sun ascends. The solitude and serene environment offer a harmonious beginning to the day, nurturing her creativity and well-being in the heart of Seoul.
As dawn breaks gently over Seoul, Ga-young finds herself at the serene Han River, a beloved sanctuary nestled within the city's heartbeat. The air is crisp, whispering promises of a new day as the sky paints itself in the soft hues of morning. The Han River Park, still in the embrace of night, begins to stir with the subtle sounds of awakening. Clad in comfortable athletic wear, her yoga mat unfurled on the dewy grass, Ga-young breathes deeply, allowing the tranquility to envelop her being.

This morning's sunrise yoga is not just a physical routine but a cherished personal ritual. As Ga-young flows through vinyasas, her movements synchronize with the rising sun, a dance between body and celestial light. The river glistens with golden reflections, turning every inhalation into an act of renewal. With each stretch and pose, she releases the burdens of her bustling Seoul life—the hustling crowds, the relentless pursuits, and the ever-looming deadlines.

The solitude of this moment is a canvas upon which she paints her thoughts, a space free from distractions. Yet her mind, always curious and often tangled in its imaginative threads, finds clarity and peace in the simplicity of being present. Listening to the gentle lapping of the river against its banks, Ga-young feels connected to something timeless and profound. The meditative state fuels her creativity, a gentle reminder that before being an artist, she is a soul in harmony with the world. As the session concludes, she rolls her mat, carrying newfound inspiration back into her artistic world, a world where stories await their storyteller.

Ga-young participates in a pottery workshop at the Seoul Pottery Studio, where she explores clay sculpting and artistic expression, finding joy and liberation in creating tangible art pieces. Amid the lively studio atmosphere, she channels inspiration from her artistic journey into crafting unique pottery, discovering a new expressive outlet.
Sunlight streamed through the large windows of the Seoul Pottery Studio, casting a warm, dappled glow over Ga-young's workspace. Tranquil, almost rhythmic lo-fi melodies pulsed through her earphones, echoing the serene mindset she sought today. Her fingers gently kneaded the soft clay, feeling its cool texture transform beneath her touch. As she delved into crafting a unique pottery piece, she imagined each curve and line telling a part of the stories that once animated her sketches.

The workshop was alive with the symphony of tinkling tools, laughter, and the gentle hum of potter's wheels. Frequent glances around the room revealed fellow artists absorbed in their creations, each surrendering to the therapeutic dance between hands and clay. Encouraged by her grandmother's love for the arts and the freedom to explore beyond her digital canvas, Ga-young sculpted with abandon, feeling delight with each imperfection that added character to her piece.

She was motivated by the thought of creating something tangible, an escape from the pixelated perfection she sought as a webtoon artist. The clay structure in her hand was growing more intricate, forming a bowl with swirling patterns - each twirl representative of dreams, fears, and the blend of her life's narrative. Emerging from her meditative process, Ga-young felt an intriguing sense of liberation, realizing how pottery afforded her creativity another vibrant dimension.
