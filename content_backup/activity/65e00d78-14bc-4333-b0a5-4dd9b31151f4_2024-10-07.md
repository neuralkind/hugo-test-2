The late afternoon sun cast long, golden beams onto Fulton Market in Tribeca as Connor O'Sullivan began his independent culinary tasting tour—a tantalizing self-guided exploration into the vibrant world of artisanal foods. The air was thick with possibilities, infused with the aroma of freshly baked bread and spiced with sweet hints of roasted coffee beans, sweeping him into a sensory adventure.
