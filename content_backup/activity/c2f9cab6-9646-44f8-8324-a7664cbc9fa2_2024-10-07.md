Dong-hoon Kang invited Li Wei
The aroma of fresh oolong and delicate jasmine teas wafts through the air as Dong-hoon, along with his friend Li Wei, steps into the serene space of the Bukchon Hanok Village, renowned for its picturesque traditional Korean homes.

Gentle autumn sunlight filters through wooden lattice windows, enveloping the room in a warm, golden glow that complements the tranquil setting. Here, surrounded by antique tea sets and scrolls depicting scenes of misty mountain ranges, they are transported into a world where every movement is a meditative act.

The host, donned in a traditional hanbok, gracefully guides them through the nuances of the tea ceremony, her fluid actions reflecting centuries of cultural tradition. She explains the symbolism behind each ritualized step - from the measured pouring of hot water to the delicate stirring of tea leaves, as Dong-hoon watches intently, relating the meditative motions to the calming influence of musical notes.

Li Wei, with his strategic mindset, is captivated by the precision involved, as the seemingly simple act of preparing tea transforms into a profound practice of mindfulness. Observing the precise ritual, he draws parallels between the discipline required in both chess and business, finding unexpected insights within these ancient customs.

As they sip the aromatic brew, serene conversations unfold, interspersed with gentle laughter. They share stories from the past and discuss the impact of cultural traditions on their modern lives, weaving a tapestry of respect and friendship. Under the thatched roof of the tea house, time slows, allowing them to savor the moment, a harmonious blend of tradition and camaraderie.

Li Wei embarks on a reflective solo bike ride along Seoul's Han River, embracing art and nature. The journey provides a peaceful escape, marrying tranquility with inspiration.
Amidst a glorious tapestry of gold and vermillion hues that mark the onset of autumn, Li Wei embarks on a solo journey to the heart of Seoul's riverside allure, the Han River. This morning, his bicycle serves not only as a vehicle but as a vessel of liberty and curiosity. As he pedals down the sinuous path that kisses the riverbanks, an invigorating breeze teases the ends of his charcoal-hued overcoat.

The lively ambiance of the Han River is drizzled with laughter and the symphony of gently rustling leaves. Li Wei navigates the vibrant display of modern sculptures, each an encapsulation of contemporary artistry fused with nature’s tranquility. Ancient mythos reflections woven with futurism captivate his astute eyes; every pedestal brims with fairies, dragons, and abstract luminescent forms that evoke deep contemplation.

Stopping by an engaging metallic installation that swivels in harmony with the wind, Li Wei dismounts, immersing himself in the artistry. A moment of awe cocoons him, akin to getting lost in a poignant novel. His time along the river is unscripted, but in the silence, his strategic mind maps out new avenues for his professional challenges, away from the turbulent metrics of business.

The couple of hours on this serene tropical escape from urban bustle rejuvenate Li Wei. As he prepares to leave the riverside symphony behind, a calming sense of clarity and invigoration embraces him closely. He pedals back toward his ventures with newfound gusto, his heart lightened by the beauty of a world often unseen in everyday pursuit.

Li Wei invited Dong-hoon Kang
In the heart of bustling Seoul, just as the evening lights began twinkling against the setting sun, Li Wei prepared for a new and unexpected venture—a pottery class at the lively Seoul Pottery Hub. This artistic pursuit, quite removed from his usual analytical endeavors, promised a refreshing canvas on which to express latent creativity. As he crossed the bustling streets, his mind buzzed with curiosity about this hands-on activity.

Upon entering the studio, a wave of earthy aromas and the subdued clatter of busy hands greeted Li. The hub was a creative sanctuary, each corner abuzz with novices and seasoned artists alike, all united in their quest to shape clay into expressions of whimsy or delicacy.

Across the room, Li spotted his friend Dong-hoon Kang, who was already exploring the array of tools and glazes with child-like enthusiasm. Known for his musical flair and artistic charisma, Dong-hoon's approach contrasted with Li's meticulous planning, which had been honed through years of business strategizing. They exchanged a warm handshake—an unspoken agreement to support one another through loops of clay and coils of style.

As the session commenced, they delved into instruction under the watchful eyes of master potter Ji-hee, whose gentle guidance revealed the subtle beauty in the art of molding clay. Between delicate shaping and bouts of laughter at imperfections immortalized in clay, the two men discovered rhythmic harmony akin to Dong-hoon’s musical sessions.

The evening blossomed into a tactile exploration. Each creative flourish on a vase or tile was a testament to Li's emerging spontaneity and Dong-hoon's joyful energy. As the pottery wheels hummed melodiously in the background, these vessels of clay held more than shape; they symbolized newfound dimensions of friendship and personal growth.
