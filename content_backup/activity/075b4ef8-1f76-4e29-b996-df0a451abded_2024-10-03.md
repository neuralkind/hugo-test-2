Chaeun joins Anna and Jihoon for a lively pottery class at the Seoul Arts Center, creatively spinning clay into personalized masterpieces.
As the bright mid-morning sun gently caressed the shimmering arches of the Seoul Arts Center, Chaeun approached with a bounce in her step. Equipping herself with an apron and clay-dappled tools, she joined the circle of attendees, each eager to mold earthy elements into artifacts of their imagination. This pottery class, nestled between the vibrancy of city life and the tranquility of artistic expression, invited a distinctive serenade of amusement and relaxation.

Chaeun's fingers danced across the cool, pliable clay, merging her spirit with the soulful essence of the earth. The spinning potter's wheel was her canvas, upon which infinite possibilities stretched. Strands of the past whispered between her fingers - reminiscent of her grandmother’s ancient ceramic vases. Around her, whispers of gentle conversation blended with the soft hum of rotating wheels.

She exchanged smiles with fellow artisans, each focused, yet sharing sly glances of encouragement. Across the table, Anna and Jihoon, both previously unacquainted with the alchemy of pottery, quizzed Chaeun on her techniques, sparking boisterous laughter when Jihoon's vessel comically collapsed. Their laughter harmonized, weaving warmth through creative focus. 

Time ebbed away unnoticed as clay molded into pots, bowls, and abstract pieces, carrying imperfect charm and individual stories. In that moment, Chaeun felt a serene connection to her essence—a bond cherished within memories, aspirations, and expressions of creativity.

Chaeun Choi embarks on a reflective solo cycling journey along Yangjaecheon Stream, eulogizing the tranquil beauty of nature enveloping Seoul.
As dusk fell over Seoul, painting a canvas of pastel pinks and cool blues, Chaeun mounted her bicycle, eager to savor the crisp autumn air and the solitude of a solo journey. The Yangjaecheon Stream sparkled under the fading sunlight, each ripple mirroring the golden hues of the setting sun. The quiet murmur of water brushing against the stones was the perfect companion to her thoughts, a gentle soundtrack blending with the rhythmic rotation of her wheels.

Her journey began at the foot of the bridge arching over the stream. Here, nature cozied itself up to the urban landscape, offering a peaceful escape from the city's relentless pace. She cycled leisurely, letting each pedal stroke be guided by a sense of present-minded tranquility. Gentle rustlings from the bushes flanked her path, where sparrows flitted and crickets sang their evening chorus, drawing her mind to times spent in meditation, just embracing the simplicity of living.

Dotted along her route were leafy pockets, where she paused occasionally to catch her breath and admire the twilight glory reflecting off the shimmer of water. In those moments, she found herself drifting back to memories of past cycles with friends, their laughter echoing against the backdrop of a thousand sunsets.

As the route wound around familiar bends, she felt a sense of connection to the street lamps that flickered to life, creating a pathway of golden light guiding her home. With each pedal stroke, she reaffirmed her commitment to living a life both in the present and in pursuit of dreams, her heart alight with the day's quiet journey and the kaleidoscope of nature's pondered beauty.
