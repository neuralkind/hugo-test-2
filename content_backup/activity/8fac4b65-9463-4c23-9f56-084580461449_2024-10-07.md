Priya embarks on a solo sunrise hike at Rattlesnake Ledge to reflect and connect with nature, aligning her aspirations amidst the tranquility of dawn.
In the crisp pre-dawn air of October 7th, Priya Desai finds herself on the verge of the Sunrise Hike and Vision Quest at Rattlesnake Ledge, WA—a serene spectacle of nature that promises refreshment for the mind and inspiration for the heart. As she sets off, her breath visible against the cool air, a profound quiet surrounds the forest, each rustle of leaves and distant birdcry things old and revered. The world is still dreamily wrapped in the embrace of night, save for the gentle whispering promise of morning ahead.

Tender familiarity finds her; Priya reflects on the trail of memories she carries, in harmony with her intent to seek clarity on future aspirations. She pauses occasionally, letting entwined thoughts disperse, clearing her mind for the journey ahead. Her vibrant attire contrasts dramatically with the tranquil greens of the forest, much like the intersection of her roles—student and magical mediator.

Reaching the summit just as the first rays of sun begin to pierce through the darkness, casting long, golden shadows and painting the rocky outcrops in sunlit hues, Priya is enveloped in a sense of serenity and anticipation. The view is breathtaking, as layers of mist nestle against towering evergreens, mirroring the layers of her own life's journey. Here, life teeters between secrecy and revelation, similar to her hesitation to fully reveal her mystical prowess.

On the ledge, she sits cross-legged, her vibrant journal resting on her lap, capturing fleeting thoughts of gratitude and sketches of potential paths forward. Every word is like a charm, setting intentions that weave her aspirations with the dawn's promise. With each stroke, she finds a sense of balance between her duties and desires—between the magic within and her place in the world. Thus, as the sun climbs higher, so does the quiet resolve within her heart—to step into her future, at peace with the shadows she may cast.
