Haelim Su engaged in a peaceful morning meditation by the Han River, reflecting on her dreams for an elderly art center, as nature's sounds enriched her practice.
As the soft hues of dawn warmed the sky, Haelim Su slipped out of her cozy apartment, drawn to the tranquil embrace of the Han River. The crisp morning air kissed her cheeks as she walked briskly under the arching trees lining the riverbank, their leaves rustling gently in the autumn breeze. Her mind, busied by the hustle of city life and her multifaceted role as a caregiver and artist, gradually began to unwind with every step toward serenity.

Arriving at her favorite grassy spot, where the river mirrored the sky's first light, Haelim spread her meditation mat. She sank into a comfortable seated position, her breath synchronizing with the river's rhythmic flow. Eyes closed, she let go of lingering distractions, allowing contemplative silence to quilt her thoughts. An inner peace, reminiscent of her soul-finding journey in the French countryside, enveloped her as the cadence of water and whispering winds framed her introspection.

Haelim's meditation practice was more than stillness; it was creative renewal. As she inhaled, she visualized her dreams—the vibrant community art center she wished to establish, where elderly voices would paint stories onto canvas. On each exhale, she freed herself from doubts, reaffirming her goals with each deliberate breath.

The Meditative ambiance transitioned from silence to symphony, merging with the natural world's symphony—a gentle chorus of birds and rustling leaves added dimension to her internal voyage. An hour and a half later, filled with renewed clarity, Haelim emerged from meditation invigorated, her path a little clearer, her spirit buoyed by hope, creativity, and community.

Haelim Su spends the evening sketching Seoul’s skyline near Namsan Tower, drawing inspiration from the city's vibrant atmosphere.
As dusk began to wrap the day in shades of twilight, Haelim Su found herself at the base of the iconic Namsan Tower. The Seoul skyline stretched out like a twinkling mosaic against the dimming sky, inviting her to capture its brilliance through her art. With a sketchbook in hand and her heart eager to explore the landscape's whispers, Haelim sought refuge among the bustling tourists and couples that gathered there.

Perched on a stone wall, she watched as the last tendrils of sunlight surrendered to the encroaching night. She breathed in the therapeutic blend of earthy tones from dampened leaves and the city’s gentle hum—a soothing reminder of the world both vast and intimate. Her pencil danced fluidly over the textured paper, sketching the bold silhouette of the tower, crowned with rays that pierced the encroaching night like a guardian beacon.

Memories of summers at her grandparents' farm merged with distant echoes from the streets below, giving her lines warmth and depth. Every stroke seemed to capture not only the majestic views but also the hues of her very soul. Haelim's artistic process became a dialogue with the city, intertwining love for her childhood memories with an artistic homage to the urban landscape she called home.

Stillness enveloped the surroundings as the city's charm embedded itself into her sketches. Each page turned was akin to flipping through a living, breathing gallery, one that attested to Haelim's ability to weave dreams through lines, strokes, and shading—a reflection of the Seoul she embraced deep in her heart.
