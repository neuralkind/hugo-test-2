Dong-hoon delves into the art of Korean Hanji at the Hanji Craft Center, crafting vibrant paper and blending history with creativity.
As the autumn leaves gently fall across Insadong's cobblestone streets, Dong-hoon steps into the Hanji Craft Center, ready to immerse himself in the age-old art of Korean paper making—an art that’s as much about tradition as it is about expression. Inside, the air is filled with warmth and promise. Beams of afternoon sun play across walls adorned with intricate Hanji designs—delicate patterns of cranes and chrysanthemums come to life in vibrant hues. 

Dong-hoon's eyes gleam with curiosity and creativity as the workshop begins with the ancient process of pulp creation. Dipping fibrous mulberry branches into a vat, he marvels at how simplicity transforms into potential. Each movement, slow and rhythmic, is a meditation of creativity akin to strumming his guitar.

For the next two hours, the workshop transforms into a bustling haven of creative energy. Craftsmen guide Dong-hoon, sharing techniques passed down through generations. With every woven sheet, he sees parallels to his compositions, layers of rhythm and artistry blending together.

As the handcrafted paper dries, participants engage in a spirited exchange, sharing stories of artistic journeys peppered with laughter and camaraderie. The session concludes with a display of finished pieces—a tapestry of handcrafted art emerging, rich with personal touches and stories. Dong-hoon leaves, clutching a stack of his creations, eager to integrate these materials into a new artistic venture at "The Groove.”
