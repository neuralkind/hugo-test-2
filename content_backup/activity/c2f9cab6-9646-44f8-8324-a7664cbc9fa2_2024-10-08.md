Li Wei embarks on a reflective evening sketching Seoul’s skyline from above. Alone, he finds tranquility and new perspectives.
Li Wei stood atop the Seoul Skyline Observation Deck, enveloped by the breathtaking panorama of the city bathed in golden hues of the setting sun. The architectural marvels of Seoul unfurled beneath him, each skyscraper a testament to the city's dynamic spirit and cultural amalgamation. Against this vibrant backdrop, Li Wei, equipped with a sketchpad and a set of graphite pencils, began translating the city's skyline onto paper.

As delicate gusts of wind swirled around him, carrying fleeting wisps of autumn, Li Wei immersed himself in the art of capturing stillness amidst motion – a metaphor for the harmony he sought in life and career. Stroke by stroke, the intricacies of Seoul’s skyline emerged, from the towering Namsan Tower to the harmonious curves of Zaha Hadid’s Dongdaemun Design Plaza.

The evening's solitude provided not only creative stimulation but also a serene backdrop for introspection. Memories of recent projects and moments of inspiration fluttered through Li's thoughts, each recollection lending a new perspective that he infused into his sketches. It wasn't merely an exercise in art but a transformative journey that paused the chaos of his routines, allowing clarity and peace to settle on each page.

Li Wei and Dong-hoon Kang revel in a soulful jazz fusion concert at the Blue Note Jazz Club, enjoying the artistry and spontaneous flow of music while deepening their bond.
Li Wei invited Dong-hoon Kang
Under the ambient lights of the Blue Note Jazz Club in Gangnam, Li Wei and his long-standing friend Dong-hoon Kang immerse themselves into a world pulsing with the vibrant echoes of jazz fusion. The room, alive with a sense of anticipation and intimacy, cradles an eclectic mix of individuals equally enraptured by the eclectic tunes. As the evening unfolds, the musicians craft a symphony born of an era of spontaneity and soul, their instruments converging into an entrancing rhythm that captivates the room.

Li Wei, normally drawn to structured environments, finds the improvised nature of jazz both exhilarating and daunting. Yet, alongside Dong-hoon’s easy, contagious enthusiasm, Li surrenders to the flow of the music, appreciating its unpredictable cadences. The two friends nod rhythmically, the occasional shared glance rich with unspoken conversation, spurred by the music's emotional currents.

As the tempo builds and recedes like waves upon a shore, Li imagines himself on a boat adrift in hushed waters, the music swirling around him. Dong-hoon, tapping instinctively to the bass line, offers Li a smile as wide as the jazz sea they are lost in. In these moments, theirs is a shared voyage through music that transcends the mundanity of daily life, uniting their different paths in a harmony found only amidst the passionate improvisation of jazz.
