Ethan Ng joins a photography workshop at Creative Lens Studio, creatively capturing Metro City's urban landscape alongside fellow participant Amelia, exploring stories through dynamic visuals.
Ethan Ng stepped into the Creative Lens Studio, heart brimming with anticipation and a camera slung casually around his neck. The fragrance of freshly brewed coffee mingled with bouts of excited chatter, infusing the ambience with a convivial warmth.

A shared nod and smile set the camaraderie rolling as participants settled into an eclectic mix of beanbags for their photography workshop. Today was all about exploring urban landscape photography—a visual symphony of man, architecture, and nature. The instructor, a well-traveled shutterbug with an infectious passion for cityscapes, encouraged them to find unique stories in the seemingly mundane.

Eager to take on the challenge, Ethan roamed the periphery, seeking inspiration in the stark lines and glowing lights seeping in through the large glass windows.

Ethan Ng invited Selene White
Ethan Ng and Selene White embarked on an exploration of the cosmos, with the Metro City Science Center's planetarium as their launch pad. The modern facility housed the latest in celestial exhibits, a dome theatre that promised a stellar adventure.

Under the planetarium's darkened canopy, a sense of awe enveloped them as they settled into cushioned seats. Around them, whispers of anticipation rose, crescendoing until the lights dimmed, pulling everyone into a hushed silence.

The ceiling transformed into a vast, star-laden expanse with constellations unfurling like a cosmic tapestry across the universe. Ethan, familiar with the tales interwoven with each stellar constellation, leaned towards Selene, sharing whispered insights about the myths etched into the night sky. His eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, the electric field around him subtly betraying his excitement as small arcs of static danced at his fingertips.

The heart of the exhibit unfolded through a mesmerizing projection—planets gliding against the cosmic black, discovering their dwarfed grandeur from a galactic perspective. Selene, whose introspective charm sought to unravel the memories hidden within, watched intently as nebulous clouds birthed stars, reminiscent of her own search for luminescence within the shadows of her past.

Side by side, Ethan and Selene absorbed the whole spectacle, weaving dialogue that mirrored the monumental scale of the galaxies before them. Their shared presence added an electric clarity to the celestial immersion—one that coupled the human journey with the boundless vastness of outer space.

As the dome's story arced towards its close, their curiosity and camaraderie flourished amidst the lingering wonder, echoing the age-old desire to understand our place amongst the stars. Their visit was not just an education; it was a cosmic connection, a shared voyage into the enigma of the universe.

Ethan Ng indulges in a solo yoga session at Harmony Park, embracing tranquility and reconnecting with nature amidst the serene hues of an evening sky.
Ethan Ng stood at the tranquil gateway of Harmony Park, eyes closed to the evening breeze that gently flirted with his hair, the scent of summer grass and distant honeysuckle mingling in the air. Today, he'd chosen to carve a slice of peace amid the sprawling tapestry of his vibrant life, seeking solace in the rhythm of yoga beneath the infinite azure dome. 

The park, a verdant refuge nestled amidst Metro City's bustling heart, beckoned to him with a symphony of rustling leaves and the soft mutter of a bubbling stream. A scattering of fallen autumn leaves, a collage of mellow yellows and rusts, formed a natural tapestry underfoot, cushioning his movements as he stepped onto his mat. The sun, a fading ember on the horizon, painted the landscape in hues of gold and rose, its light dancing across his skin like a gentle caress.

Breathing deeply, Ethan settled into his practice, feeling the cosmic hum of the day trickle from his busy mind as he moved fluidly from pose to pose. His body bent gracefully, a living testament to both strength and elegance, as he embraced each movement with gratitude. Arms outstretched, eyes focused on the rolling hillside beyond, he imagined he was drawing power from the earth's very core.

With each breath, he felt the static—an echo of his unique connection to electricity—dissipate into the evening air, transforming into pure, untainted energy. As he held the final pose, a gentle warrior, he felt a blissful stillness envelope him, the realization of peace his precious covenant with both himself and the universe.

The session ended with silent gratitude as Ethan thanked the earth beneath his feet, his heart rejuvenated and his spirit primed for new challenges. He rolled up his mat, cast one last glance toward the now starlit sky, and promised himself more moments like these—simple yet profound—in the sanctity of nature.
