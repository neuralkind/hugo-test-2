JiHoon explores and captures the essence of Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, blending his love for photography and cultural appreciation on a solo morning walk.
The sun-painted, idyllic neighborhood of Seoul's Bukchon Hanok Village welcomed JiHoon on this crisp autumn morning. With his trusty camera nestled in hand, his adventure embarked alone yet surrounded by the ghostly echoes of stories embedded in every brick and tile. JiHoon’s footsteps resonated gently against the cobblestone paths, each stone an unwritten chapter waiting to be captured.

Harmonizing past with present, the village was an interlude of time. JiHoon was drawn eagerly to the elegantly bent rooftops of Hanoks, their traditional architecture like etchings against the perfect blue of the sky. He paused beneath the branches of Gingko trees, leaves teetering between shades of gold and green, illuminating their value in his lens. 

Each frame captured was a glimpse into life’s simpler moments—the elderly sellers arranging herbs with ritualistic care, school children whizzing past on bicycles, and artisans meticulously crafting ceramics behind open windows, all lending his photographs a vibrant narrative.

With every 'click', JiHoon saw more than the scene. He found stories to tell—ones he would echo through his budding mental health initiative, merging the visual serenity of his photographs with wellness advocacy somehow. As he slowly made his way downhill, the documenter in him rejoiced, his heart thrumming along to tales unheard and lives unseen, deep in the fabric of Bukchon.
