The air shimmers with anticipation as she stands amidst an eclectic array of percussion instruments, each beckoning with vibrant potential.

The instructor—a sprightly young woman named Bianca, whose love for percussion is as vibrant as her spirit—welcomes participants with a warm smile and a rhythmical patter that sets the tone for the day's adventures. As the session kicks off, Leila is paired with an enthusiastic participant named Javier, whose natural knack for rhythm syncs well with Bianca's expertise. Leila, with her strategic insight and curiosity, dives into the intricate realm of samba rhythms and maracatu. She loses herself in the beats, her hands dancing across the cuíca as if they held the secrets of her time-tinkering magic.

Bianca takes time to explore the story behind each beat, drawing parallels to strategic rhythms of life—a narrative that resonates deeply with Leila. As they progress, instruments such as surdo and tamborim fill the air, their resonances mirroring heartbeats. The group moves, sways, and drums in unison, dissolving into laughter and encouraging each other when missed beats arise. In these shared connections, Leila senses the magic that lies in unity and rhythm—echoes of camaraderie typically found in her magical councils.

As the session unfolds, the studio pulsates with a mix of traditional tunes and new-age interpretations, leaving impressions of a thoroughly engaging cultural exchange.
