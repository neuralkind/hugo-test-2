Ethan Ng invited Selene White
Today, Ethan and Selene embark on a culinary exploration at the London Culinary Arts Center. Together with Max—a renowned fusion chef known for blending traditional Asian spices with modern Western techniques—they navigate their way through a whirl of savory aromas and vibrant colors. Lagoon-blue glass cabinets teem with vivid turmeric and ruby-colored paprika. Stainless steel stations gleam under pot lights, reflecting the creative magic afoot. 

Ethan, equipped with his intrinsic understanding of technologically-infused processes, deftly operates the induction stove, orchestrating a symphony of sizzling vegetables infused with lemongrass, shimmering amidst steam. Meanwhile, Selene, an artist at heart, masterfully plates their creation, swirling a rich avocado puree that looks like flowing green silk. Her magical touch subtly rearranges the colors into a kaleidoscope, unnoticed by the mundane eye.

Max guides them with passionate flair, explaining the science behind melding soy caramel with balsamic reductions. Ingredients dance, swapping cultural tales as if members of a grand masquerade, as laughter ricochets off the cherry-wood walls, coaxed by genial competition.

The workshop transforms into a harmonious blending of flavors, aromas, and techniques, reflecting an unspoken challenge: mastering taste through imagination while preserving the precious nuances of tradition. The trio’s combined efforts birth intricate dishes that transcend mere sustenance—culinary magic woven from hybrid heritages and unconstrained innovation.

Selene White takes an evening stroll through a lamp-lit woodland trail, engaging in an introspective journey surrounded by the tranquility of autumn foliage. Embracing the solitude, she reflects on her mystical identity and finds balance in the serene environment.
Selene White stepped onto the Lamp-lit Woods Trail, the evening air crisp and tinged with the scent of fallen leaves underfoot. The sky above stretched like a velvet canvas dotted with shimmering constellations, each star whispering secrets to the quiet world below. As she ventured deeper into the woods, the amber glow of street lamps created intricate patterns upon the winding path, catching in her pale hair and casting dappled reflections in her haunted gaze.

The rhythmic crunch of leaves beneath her feet was a comforting melody, matching the rhythm of her heartbeat. With each step, she felt herself loosening the burdens of her magical identity, embracing the silence of the forest as a sanctuary. Golden leaves twirled in the gentle breeze, becoming an ethereal dance that resonated with the sensitive chords of her heart. Selene's thoughts flowed like an autumnal stream, meandering between memories and dreams, guided by instinct more than intent.

In the solitude of this sacred retreat, she reached for tranquility within and steadied her mind with each breath. Here, amidst the ancient listening trees, thoughts of her travels stirred behind her eyes, drawing connections between the mysticism of her experiences. The woodland scents, the pathway draped in moonlit shadows, stirred an artful meditation, paving the way for moments of profound introspection and serene clarity.

Her hand occasionally brushed the trunks, feeling a resonance of history and whispers of happenings etched into the bark. With no distractions but the rustling leaves and the murmurs of the night, Selene felt the world slowly unveiling itself, and her spirit, expansively unfolding, reconnecting with universal magic that seemed to blossom in these illuminated groves.

By the time she reached the trail's end, she felt undoubtedly lighter, her heart capacitated with renewed insights that emerged through solitude and reflection. The evening stroll had proved transformative, allowing space for her world to unfurl anew, culminating in a resonate harmony found amidst the glowing autumn woods.
