Under a canopy of rustling leaves and the crisp whisper of the autumn breeze, Mi-young Song steps into the tranquil outdoor pottery studio in Seoul. The air is dense with earthy aromas, inviting forays into the world of tactile creation. Mi-young's eyes glimmer with anticipation as she is about to delve into the tender art of pottery-making, exploring creativity amid nature's embrace. Around her, clay rests in quiet anticipation, piled high on wooden tables, with tools of various shapes and functionality spread like a buffet of possibilities. 

Embracing the juxtaposition of serenity and hands-on engagement, Mi-young seats herself at a wheel. Her hands, sculpted by past travels and new experiences, eagerly shape lumps of clay into forms yet imagined. With each steady whirl of the wheel, the malleable earth takes form, reflecting the convergence of artistic intent and earthy humility.

As the morning unfolds, the studio fills with the melodious cadence of creativity—a harmony of laughter from fellow creators, the soft music of spinning wheels, and the lilt of gentle guidance as the instructor shares wisdom carried through generations. The vibe is communal, each person immersed in their universe while resonating with a shared purpose: to shape the raw earth.

As the leaves rustle with autumn's whisper, Mi-young Song mounts her bicycle and embarks on a solo journey along the Han River Trails, seeking solace and inspiration in Seoul’s vivid fall landscape. The air is crisp, charged with the serenity that arrives only with the changing seasons. The path is shrouded in shades of gold and crimson, each leaf catching the late afternoon sun with a dance that mirrors her own spirit of adventure.

Cycling leisurely, Mi-young is enveloped by the blend of nature's hues and the river’s tranquil embrace. Her camera, ever her companion, swings lightly at her side, ready to capture moments of ethereal beauty—a distant tree refracted in the river's sheen, a breeze-prompted symphony as the trees sway in unison.

She pauses occasionally, not just to photograph but to breathe—inhaling the fragrance of the surrounding pines and exhaling the busyness of the city left behind. Her thoughts drift to yesterday's potluck with Yuna Park, pondering the warmth of camaraderie and how the constancy of these trails also mirrors enduring friendships.

As the sun begins its descent, painting long shadows across her path, Mi-young reflects on her journey that mirrors life's currents—swift at times, tranquil at others. With the cycle path now a vibrant corridor of reflection and discovery, she pedals on, greeting fellow bikers with nods that carry unspoken stories of shared tranquility.
