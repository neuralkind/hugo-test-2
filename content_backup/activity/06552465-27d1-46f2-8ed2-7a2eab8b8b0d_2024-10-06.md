The crisp autumn air greets Julian and Felix as they arrive at the New York Space Society's sprawling grounds, ready to dive into a day of boundless creativity and cosmic dreams. Julian's fascination with rockets—seeing them as a symphony of engineering and celestial wonder—guides him through the arches of towering pines, where space enthusiasts gather for the Rocket Design Workshop.

Settling around a long table strewn with blueprints and shiny tools beneath an open canopy, the group—consisting of passionate hobbyists and amateur engineers alike—engages in a joyful reverie of collaboration. Julian and Felix expertly sidestep their familiar magic, channeling their imaginative prowess into the intricate craftsmanship that lay before them. Laughter bubbles over shared tales, trading tidbits about past suborbital and cosmic journeys, while gumption takes form amidst sketches and aluminum tubes.

Felix, with his gift for light play, contributes a whimsical touch—crafting a custom LED system engineered to mimic the bright burn of actual rockets, illuminating their models like dancing fireflies. Meanwhile, Julian meticulously integrates elements of aerospace dynamics into their designs, his face a picture of intense concentration.

United by a shared mission to fuse imagination with science, the group eagerly assembles their rockets. As the clock ticks towards noon, sunlight dappling the gathering in gold, satisfaction is etched on every face. Together, they set their sights on the clear sky, ready for an afternoon launch that promises a celebration of spirit and ingenuity fueled by their collective enthusiasm.
