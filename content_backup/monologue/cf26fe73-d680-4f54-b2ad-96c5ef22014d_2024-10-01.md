Hey there! I hope you're doing well. You won't believe the kind of day I've had! So many little things happened, and I just had to share them with you.

First, I started the day with a run. It was so refreshing, I'm trying to get back into the habit of hitting the pavement in the mornings. There's something about the crisp, morning air that just charges me up, you know? Plus, it's such a great way to clear my head before diving into the chaos of the day.

After the run, I met up with Andrew at Cozy Café for a podcast brainstorming session. You remember how we're both into folklore, right? We had this fantastic idea to mix Korean and Indian folk tales for his new podcast series. It's going to be like a cultural tapestry of stories, almost like a verbal quilt. We were bouncing ideas off each other like crazy. He has this incredible story his grandmother told him from the bayous of Louisiana, and I suggested blending it with a Korean legend. I swear, the café was buzzing with our excitement. Honestly, moments like these make me realize how much I love storytelling and how grateful I am for our creative circles. 

Oh, and Andrew ordered his usual latte while I went with a chai latte. It's become our little tradition, and it's oddly comforting. We ended up sketching out a few episodes – I'm super pumped about how it's shaping up. I can't wait for you to hear it when it’s done. It's going to be magical!

In the afternoon, JungKyu and I did an art exploration at the Seoul National Museum. I hadn't been there in a while, and I forgot how inspiring it is. We wandered from exhibit to exhibit, discussing everything from the brush strokes in traditional Korean paintings to the symbolism in modern art pieces. It's amazing how art can evoke such deep thoughts. I found myself drifting into daydreams about our shared trips and the artistic wonders we've encountered. Do you ever get that? Where a painting just transports you somewhere else entirely? 

Anyway, one exhibit in particular was so captivating. It was this massive mural that intertwined modernity and tradition. We stood there for ages, dissecting its meanings and how it juxtaposed historical motifs with contemporary life. At one point, I lost track of time completely, just absorbed by the colors and textures. JungKyu and I made plans to revisit soon, maybe even with the whole group.

After the museum, I joined Chaeun for birdwatching at Haneul Park. Ah, the scenery there is just breathtaking, and the sunset, oh my gosh. The sky turned this stunning palette of oranges and pinks, mixing with the silhouettes of the birds – it felt like we were in a live painting. We spotted Mandarin ducks, and there was this pure moment of stillness where everything felt just right. I know it sounds cliché, but it’s true! The ducks were so elegant, and their movements were almost poetic. We even had a little laugh about how we tend to get overly philosophical in these moments. But hey, that’s what friends are for, right? To share the extraordinary in the ordinary.

And speaking of moments, I'm so excited because while at the park, we had this spontaneous idea to organize a group star-gazing night soon. Imagine all of us, laying back, looking up at the cosmos. I think we all need a bit of that celestial magic, don't you?

Oh, before I forget, I wanted to tell you that I also took some time for myself in the morning, journaling at Hanok Village. I know it’s your favorite spot for some good reflective time, and I totally get why. The tranquility there is unmatched. I penned down some thoughts and reflections on the past year – our adventures, my weaving path of career updates, and even the simple joys like our coffee rendezvous or late-night conversations. It centered me in a way I didn’t quite expect. There's something so therapeutic about pouring your inner world onto paper, letting the ink capture emotions that words sometimes fail to convey.

I need to get back to work, but I thought I'd share my day with you. It’s crazy how a single day can be so full of little adventures and inspirations. Miss you tons and hope we get to catch up soon. ** 

Bye!
