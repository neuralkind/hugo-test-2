Hey! I wanted to catch you up on my day. 

So, this morning started off quite peacefully with my green tea ritual, followed by a bit of cello practice. There's something so calming about the low hum of the cello strings resonating through the quiet stillness of the early hours. I can't wait until I'm good enough to play a full piece without stumbling. It's a work in progress, but every note feels like a small victory.

After that, I joined the group chat for a bit. Everyone is just so active and doing such inspiring things. It seems like today was a big day for activities! Chaeun, Neha, and Jesse went birdwatching, which sounded magical. They spotted a Mandarin duck and Jesse even did a sketch of it! I'm so jealous – I'd love to join them one day. Imagine bringing my sketchbook and just drawing all those beautiful birds. Speaking of sketches, Chloé and I had such an amazing art discussion this afternoon. We delved into some new themes and techniques for our upcoming projects. She’s such an inspiring artist; bouncing ideas off her always leaves me feeling incredibly motivated. We should definitely try another art session soon, maybe even a collab piece!

Before I forget, I had this lovely brainstorming session with JiYong and Andrew at a cozy café downtown. The atmosphere there was perfect, especially with the rain gently pattering against the window. It's as if the world outside just paused for a bit while we were deep in our designs for JiYong's beachside café idea. I love how passionate JiYong is about creating a space that threads stories like sea breezes through every conversation. He's got such a vivid imagination! And Andrew's sketches – oh my gosh – they are simply next level. We were laughing and scribing our own little narratives about what the café could be, trying to imagine people from all walks of life gathering there. I particularly loved Andrew’s idea of the 'Stories Bench' by the windows – where patrons can jot down snippets of their stories for others to read. Isn’t that just fantastic? 

I have to say, this collaborative vibe made me feel so alive and connected. There’s this incredible satisfaction in shaping something beautiful with friends who share the same creative spirit. But also, those caramel lattes and carrot cake slices were to die for. Who knew brainstorming could be this delightful? 

Oh, by the way, when I got back home, I started thinking about incorporating some of the café design aesthetic into my ceramics. Imagine clay vases that reflect the themes of coastal retreat – so serene and inviting. I’m so excited just thinking about it! I might experiment with integrating slim bamboo strands into the clay. It's something JiYong suggested during one of our pottery sessions. The idea is to create a skeletal framework that burns away in the kiln, leaving intricate patterns. Can you picture it? I’m sure it’s going to be quite an adventure. Creating art is like this wonderful journey of discovery where every turn brings you closer to something unknown but absolutely rewarding.

In between these bursts of creativity, I managed to catch up with the group chat again. Neha and JungKyu had a poetry reading at the Cozy Book Café. It sounded like such an enriching experience. Both of them have such a way with words. Oh, and Andrew and JiYong had this buzzing podcast planning session. Sometimes I wish I could split myself into several people to join all these amazing activities! 

Later in the evening, I had a lovely virtual art discussion with Chloé, as I was setting up my workspace at home. Despite being miles apart, it felt like she was right there beside me. We discussed themes for our next project and Chloé’s input always leaves me so inspired and ready to dive into new creative challenges. 

Following that, I jumped onto another call with JiYong to continue our beachside café design discussion. We were so engrossed in imagining immersive live storytelling sessions and thematic snacks inspired by different coastal cultures. Can you imagine sipping a warm, aromatic tea while listening to a live storyteller capture everyone’s imagination with a tale? It makes me smile just thinking about it. 

After the calls, I took a moment on my balcony to soak in the last light of the evening. There's a certain stillness that comes with twilight, and today, it felt especially comforting. Oh! I almost forgot to mention that I saw Chaeun and Jesse after their art and tea collaboration at Hanok Tea House. It’s always such a delight to see what they create together. You can feel a palpable energy of creativity and friendship in the air. 

By the way, Chloé’s rooftop yoga session sounds amazing. You know how much I love evening yoga – it’s like a gentle closure to the day, grounding and peaceful. We should all definitely plan that group session soon. Maybe even at the beachside café once it’s up and running!

Anyway, I’m rambling a bit here, aren’t I? Just wanted to share these little slices of my day with you. It’s these moments of connection – with friends, with art, with nature – that make life so wonderfully rich.

I need to get back to work on the sketches. Catch you later!
