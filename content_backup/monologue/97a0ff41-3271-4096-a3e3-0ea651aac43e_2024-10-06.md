Oh my gosh, today has been so wonderfully crazy!
 So, you know how I tend to jump feet-first into things? Well, true to form, this morning I tried my hand at potteryâ€”and let me tell you, it's way harder than it looks! Picture the most fabulous mess of clay ever: that's basically what I created. ðŸ˜‚ The instructor, this amazing local artist, had the most fascinating stories tied to each piece of pottery, pieces swirling with cultural love and attention to delicate detail. Listening to him, I felt that familiar itch of hunger to blend these age-old arts into modern fashion traditions.

But let me tell you, shaping clay is kind of like designing that perfect outfit. Each touch, each little spin of the potterâ€™s wheel, was like adjusting the fit of your favorite dress; every curve was a statement of its own. I felt this profound connection to both simplicity and complexity, just like that golden thread winding its way through all the different beads, creating a stunning whole. Let's just say, I may have the beginnings of at least three lookbook ideas spinning around in my head.

Of course, we couldnâ€™t just stop there. In need of a little soul healing and before submerging back into the bustling chaos, I took a deep breath and soaked in some nature with a bit of forest bathing at Namsan. Everything slowed as I meandered through those emerald draped paths, feeling time halt with each step. Imagine the echo of leaf whispers around youâ€”a gentle dance of sunlight filtering through, painting shadows that danced across my clothes, each step echoing how style and nature can so vividly inspire one another.

My mind wandered, stepping into that serene dance, absorbing every hue and texture nature offered. It was like my mental creative sketchbook was suddenly flipping through pages Iâ€™d never seen before. Soft emerald slipping into the warmest earth tones, broken by the occasional pop of brilliant fall colorsâ€”it was fashion painted by the fingertips of the natural world itself. A palette shift. Iâ€™m going down a rabbit hole with a rustic fusion idea in mind for my next collection!

And speaking of blending the old with the new, I spent the evening with Mi-young at that swanky dinner in Gangnam. You know her vibrant energy, right? Sheâ€™s like a human catalyst! Our conversation sparkled over this exquisite blend of flavors that was basically art on a plate. There's something magical about engaging with someone who sees the world as a patchwork quilt, where every corner is an inspiration squareâ€”each piece carrying a story from a different world. We exchanged tales of fashion triumphs and setbacks and laughed about how sometimes all we need to fix a bad day is a glass of something bubbly and a pair of good shoes. Absolute legend right there.
You know, as I was shaping that clay at the workshop, I couldn't help but draw comparisons with the whole collaborative dance of fashion. Like, each movement - from your hands guiding the wheel, to the intentional breath you take as you decide on the smallest detail, to the discussions and bouncing ideas off people like we did last night with Mi-young - it all contributes to this tapestry of experiences. 

Isn't it funny how these seemingly disparate activities, like breathing in the serenity of Namsan or savoring culinary delights in Gangnam, somehow link back to our work? Like, when Mi-young and I were at the dinner, we managed to weave in themes from our forest walksâ€”turning every taste into a story of culture and nature, much like how you reimagine elements in fashion. It felt like a living exhibit, where each bite was tinged with stories we'd gathered throughout the day. 

And oh, the details! Can you imagine the synergy between the smooth contours of pottery and the gentle textures of forest paths, magically translating into wearable art? It's like we're modeling these stories not just in clay or fabric, but in experiences that tie together everything from our cultural insights to everyday wonders. 

Plus, listening to Mi-young unpack her latest wanderlust stories, with each dish echoing an itinerary, got me thinking about our shared journeys - how each destination gifts us different patterns, color palettes, and if we're lucky, a moment of illumination. Even our playful musings over that fashion blendâ€”a touch of Hanbok here, a sprinkle of street chic thereâ€”seemed to perfectly capture our desire to keep tasting the world. 

What I love is how these inspirations donâ€™t segregate themselves. They mingle, creating such vibrant nuances in our creations, much like the breathtaking fusion of modernity and tradition on lively Seoul streets. The essence we pull from, say, a vintage market or the calm of a teahouse, it transforms into something bigger and more beautiful when we finally sit down to create. 

And speaking of being creative with constraints, Mi-young and I found ourselves joking about our unintentional masterclass in speed networking. You know how it is, trying to seize every gilded thread of opportunity while it glistens right in front of you. I swear, we must've crossed paths with half the industry elite in one night! Seriously, the best part? The stories and laughs exchanged over a shared dessert make what could be an overwhelming hustle feel warm and rewarding. 

The whole experience leaves me riding this wonderful wave of realization, that more than just the designs themselves, what truly embeds them with life are these momentsâ€”the eclectic stories, friendships, and inspiration after inspiration, coiling into an endless dance of creativity and connection. So, each curve of clay, each twist of fabric, they become narratives in their own right...


Imagine me, walking into that pottery workshop, feeling like a fish out of water. But I love trying new things, and you know meâ€”eager for a challenge! The place had this earthy aroma that was just divine. It was almost as if the clay whispered unlocking secrets of its hidden potential. And oh, the instructor had this amazing way of storytelling! Each pot seemed to have a tale woven into its curves. I think I might have sat there, clay-caked, grinning like a kid in a candy store.

Somehow, the whole clay-shaping process reminded me of the artistry involved in fashionâ€”so much so that each rotation of the potterâ€™s wheel felt symphonic, like the crescendo in a fashion show. I mean, who knew that pressing into clay could strike such a chord with designing couture? The way textures reveal themselves in both textiles and crafts is just fascinating. Most of my creations ended up a bit, let's say, "abstract," but it stirred up ideas I can't wait to play with.

And then there was the forest bathing at Namsan. As I wandered amongst the trees, I was struck by the serene complexity of nature. It's so elusive, like trying to catch fog, yet it rooted me to a deeper calm. The foliage seemed to wrap around me, painting everything with mossy greens and soft brownsâ€”it grounded my dizzy head, especially after the whirl of the ceramics. It was like nature itself was a mood board ready to inspire my next collection.

And this was before the dinner at the Gastronomy Lounge with Mi-young. Meeting her always feels like a burst of fresh creativity! Our conversation danced around like a well-rehearsed pas de deux, each word encouraging the other. We bantered about our shared adventures, blending tales of Seoulâ€™s vibrant subcultures with the broader spectrum of the global fashion scene. You know when youâ€™re with someone who speaks your language? Fashion-wise, I mean. Those exchanges of ideas are like a live-wire connection!

I swear, savoring each intricately crafted dish made the evening all the more surreal, like feasting on a chefâ€™s canvas. Mi-young had this radiant energy as if each story she shared was an afterimage of her latest escapade. Somehow, by the end of the night, it felt like even the desserts had devoured the threads of inspiration. Every shared bite tasted like dreams sewn together with the fibers of ambition.

I couldn't help but feel that the dots connected between pottery, the introspective journey through Namsan, and dinnerâ€”these moments intertwined creating a tapestry of inspiration. Each experience a reminder that creativity flourishes not just in fashion, but everywhere, like little sparkles around us waiting to be recognized. How each moment could be stitched right into the seams of my designs.
Anyway, just had to share these thoughts. Talk soon, thereâ€™s more to come!
