Hey there!

You know what? Today was like one of those days where everything just clicks, you know? It all started with my sunrise meditation. I swear, the garden looked like it was straight out of a painting, the way the morning light just gently kissed everything awake. There’s something magical about those early moments; it’s like the world is whispering secrets just to you. I can still smell the fresh grass and the faint whisper of the wind chimes. It really got me in the right headspace for the day.

So after that serene start, I headed over to Gwangalli Beach café. Total nostalgia trip! I decided to bring Jesse along since he’s always up for a creative session. We both grabbed our usual spots by the window, armed with our journals and sketchpads. Honestly, the vibe there is so inspiring. The way the sunlight played on the wooden tables made everything feel golden and alive. I was knee-deep in my writing when Jesse pointed out this cute couple getting engaged right by the water. It was such a sweet moment! We both took a pause to just absorb the happiness radiating from them. 

Writing at the beach always brings back memories of our childhood trips there, doesn't it? I kept imagining us running around, building sandcastles, and just being our carefree selves. It's amazing how much that place still feels like home, even with the passage of time. Jesse and I ended up brainstorming a bit for his new art project too. He’s diving into some pretty intense themes about nostalgia and memory. It’s fascinating to see how our childhood memories inspire his work.

Oh, before I forget, something really funny happened with one of the seagulls. You know how they always hang around, right? One cheeky bird swooped in and snatched a piece of Jesse’s pastry right off his plate! We both laughed so hard—Jesse even made a quick sketch of the "culprit" mid-theft. It was perfect comic relief.

By late afternoon, the two of us decided to switch gears and head over to Haneul Park for birdwatching. Neha met us there, and it felt like a mini-adventure. There’s something so calming about being surrounded by nature, especially with the skyline of Seoul painting a contrast in the background. We spotted some gorgeous Mandarin ducks. Their colors were so vivid; it was like seeing little jewels floating on the water. I could feel Jesse’s excitement bubbling over. He was sketching away, and I caught him smiling to himself a few times as he got lost in his art.

You know, birdwatching always gives me this incredible sense of peace. There's this weird therapeutic aspect to it—like an unspoken connection between us and those free spirits. It’s a silent kind of joy. Neha and I talked about our favorite birds, and it was cool to see how different our preferences are. She loves the flamboyant peacocks, and I’m all about the serene cranes. It’s funny how these little things reflect our personalities.

The evening wrapped up beautifully. We headed back, with the warm glow of the sunset keeping us company. The sky was this mix of oranges and purples, almost like a watercolor painting. Jesse showed us the sketches he made during the day, and they were stunning. We all agreed that a gallery night featuring his new pieces would be a great idea. Maybe we can turn it into a little get-together, invite some friends over for a cozy night of art and good company.

On another note, I’ve been thinking a lot about our future travels. There's just so many places I still want to explore. Neha and I chatted about maybe planning a humanitarian trip together soon, perhaps somewhere we can both immerse ourselves in the local culture and give back. It’s been a while since my Kathmandu trip, and I’ve been itching for another meaningful adventure.

Oh, and speaking of meaningful experiences, I had a really touching moment today during our birdwatching trip. This elderly couple walked by us, holding hands and speaking in hushed, affectionate tones. It reminded me of my grandparents and the stories they used to tell us. There’s something so pure about love that withstands the test of time. It got me reflecting on the relationships in my life and how grateful I am for our friendship. Moments like these make me cherish our bond even more.

Before I sign off, I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you always being there to listen. Sharing these little snippets of my day with you makes everything feel that much more special. Can't wait to hear about how your day went! Maybe we can catch up over a call soon.

Okay, I need to get back to some editing work now. Talk to you later! Bye!
