Hey there! So, you know what? Today was kind of a roller-coaster in the most beautiful, serene way if that makes any sense. Buckle up because I've got a lot to share!

This morning started super peaceful. I took an early walk through Bukchon Hanok Village. I mean, you know how much I love that place! I had my camera with me and was just snapping away at everything—those traditional rooftops against the blue sky are always so picture-perfect. I actually caught this elderly vendor setting up her herbs, and oh man, the way she arranged them was like art. Every little bundle had a story, you know?

You know that feeling when you're just in the zone, and everything clicks? Well, that was me today, right under the Gingko trees whose leaves were turning that gorgeous shade of gold. I was thinking about how to use these photos for my upcoming mental health initiative. Like, how cool would it be to pair these serene images with wellness tips and stories? Kind of like blending visual art with healing. I'm super pumped just thinking about it!

Oh, and then, around noon, I met up with Haelim. We had this awesome herbal gathering experience planned. I swear, time just flies when you’re having those deep, engaging conversations while surrounded by nature. We explored the Korean Herb Garden in Gangwon, and it was something straight out of a dream. I was babbling stories about ginseng and how it’s been this ancient cure-all in Korean culture. Haelim was sketching away and making these incredible drawings of the unique herbs we found. Those sketches? They’re going to fit so well into her art therapy projects. We even had a bit of a picnic under a pine tree, sharing some rice cakes and ginger tea. Talk about blissful moments! It was one of those times you wish could last forever.

And guess what? I wrapped up the day with a webinar on photography and wellness. Our friend Chloé joined in, and it was absolutely enriching. We talked about how captured moments can offer solace and hope. Chloé added her own touch with breathing techniques that meshed perfectly with the images I shared. Imagine learning how to calm your mind while looking at a serene autumn scene from Bukchon. It was magical. The whole thing felt like a confluence of visual storytelling and mental well-being, and I think it resonated with everyone there.

Oh, by the way, fun fact! I had to laugh because during the webinar, Chloé brought up a memory of our lunch last week where we all had a good laugh after our vocal practice session. It’s those little things, you know? Reminds me just how much these small moments add up to something really special.

Before I forget, I ran into JiYong afterward, and he shared this sketch he's working on for his dream beachside café. It’s coming along so nicely! I think he’s really going to nail the vibe there. Anyways, he mentioned wanting a live storytelling session by Andrew when it's all set up. I can see it now—tropical snacks, a cool sea breeze, and Andrew spinning tales. Can you imagine how great that would be?

And, oh, talking about Andrew, he was brainstorming podcast ideas today. I didn't catch all the details but it sounds super exciting. Knowing him, whatever he comes up with will be gold.

You’d have loved to see Jesse’s sketches from his sunrise session at Gyeongui Line Forest Park this morning. They’re stunning. He said it was just what he needed. Isn't it funny how everyone’s finding their own way to get inspired?

The evening totally mellowed out though. After the webinar, I decided to wind down with a quiet moment in the art district. There’s just something so therapeutic about connecting with creativity, whether it’s your own or someone else's. It was exactly what I needed to center myself after a day filled with such variety and activity.

You know these days where everything just feels so balanced and in sync? That was today. I felt like I was in my element from start to finish. Sometimes it’s the simple pleasures and those little interactions that make the day so fulfilling.

I need to get back to work, but I wanted to share all this with you. Catch you later!
