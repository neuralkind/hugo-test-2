Hey there!

So, you know how my mornings always start with some form of quiet reflection? Well, today was no different. I made my way to the Han River Park just as the sun was coming up. The air was so crisp, and the river looked like it was wrapped in gold! The peace that place brings me—it’s like pressing a reset button. I sat there for a good hour, just meditating and listening to the world wake up.

After that, I had this burst of creative energy, so I decided to work on a little art project at home. You know how I’ve been into memory-inspired pieces lately? Well, today, I tried to capture the essence of our last trip to Sydney. I spent a good two hours working on it, and every brushstroke felt like I was reliving those moments. The laughter, the scenic views, the camaraderie—we really made some unforgettable memories there. It's amazing how our experiences can vividly come back to life through art.

Speaking of creativity, I had my poetry recital this evening, remember? I was a little nervous, as always, but it turned out fantastic! It was at Cozy Book Café, and Neha and Chloé showed up to support me. Honestly, having familiar faces in the audience made all the difference. They both have this incredible way of making you feel like you're not alone, you know? I performed a couple of my new pieces inspired by our adventures in Sydney and Tokyo. The audience seemed to really connect with the stories I was weaving through my poems. There was this one moment when I recited a piece about the cherry blossoms in Tokyo, and I could see the wonder on everyone's faces—it was magical.

Oh, and another highlight! After the recital, Neha and I stayed back for this historical literature exchange session. We always have such rich conversations about history and literature. It’s like each time we delve into these topics, we uncover more layers of understanding and appreciation. Tonight, we were talking about ancient civilizations and their impact on modern society. It was so engaging! Neha mentioned something about how certain cultural practices we observe today have roots going back thousands of years, and it sparked this whole discussion. Our little group at the café was so engrossed, we didn’t even notice time flying by. 

You know, it's these moments of connection and shared passion that I really cherish. Whether it's through poetry, art, or deep conversations, there’s something incredibly fulfilling about exploring the world together—even if it's just through our experiences and memories. Ah, life’s little joys, right?

On a lighter note—guess what? I found a new little café around the corner from my place, and it has the best matcha latte I’ve ever had. You’d love it. I can already imagine you making a beeline for it as soon as you visit next. And speaking of things you'll love, I finally tried the kimchi pancakes at this new Korean fusion place. They were mouthwatering! I’ll take you there when you’re in town. 

Oh, by the way, before I forget, I got this hilarious email from one of our old uni friends. It seems they're planning a little reunion soon. Can you believe it’s already been so many years? Time really flies. I’m looking forward to catching up with everyone, reminiscing our good old days, and probably cringing at some of our past fashion choices! 

Anyway, enough about me—you have to tell me how your day went. Did anything out of the ordinary happen? You always have such interesting stories. And don't leave out any details; you know I'm all ears!

I need to get back to work. Catch you later!
