Hey, it's Seohee! I just had to fill you in on my day. It's been an interesting mix of relaxation, creativity, and some laughter, of course.

So, you know how much I love sketching outside, right? Well, I started my morning off with a little trip to Han River Park. The weather was perfect, that delightful crispness to the air that only autumn brings. I found this quiet spot near the water where the willow trees almost felt like they were swaying to a hidden melody. Every detail was so inspiring; it made me think of those childhood trips to Jeju Island. Do you remember those shells we used to collect? Anyway, every stroke of my pencil felt therapeutic, like I was capturing a piece of serenity and keeping it for safekeeping.

But here’s the funny part. I was so lost in my sketching that I didn't notice a little squirrel that had been watching me the entire time. I guess it was curious because it came right up next to me and started inspecting my tools! I was torn between laughing and trying not to scare the poor thing away. Eventually, I had to gently shoo it off, but it left me with a smile. Nature has such a charming way of surprising us, doesn’t it?

After the park, I met up with JiYong for our ceramics workshop in Incheon. You have to see the new technique he taught me: integrating slim bamboo strands into the clay. It was genius! Watching the bamboo burn away in the kiln, leaving behind an intricate skeletal design, was mesmerising. I made this delicate vase incorporating some floral engravings. I think the experience brought out a blend of my sketching finesse and my pottery skills. It was one of those moments that remind you why you fell in love with art in the first place.

JiYong and I had a blast experimenting with different designs, but there was this hilarious bit where I accidentally splattered clay all over his face. It was like a scene from a comedy! Despite the mess, he just chuckled and said, "That's the price of creativity!" We ended up with clay smeared everywhere but also with some beautiful new pieces. I think we created something truly unique together, and it just reinforced how much art can bond us with others.

Oh, and before I forget, I grabbed lunch afterward at that cute little café by the ceramics studio. They serve the most delightful green tea, you know, the one I always rave about. So comforting. It's like a ritual that never gets old, especially after a session of intense creativity. It's grounding and helps me to just, you know, centre myself amidst all the activity.

Later, I had a quick chat with Choeun. She’s been birdwatching with Jesse at Cheonggyecheon Stream. She mentioned they spotted a rare species today, and now she's all excited about writing an article on it. Her passion is so infectious; it makes me want to pick up something new too.

Also, I caught up with Neha briefly this evening. We exchanged stories about our day and she’s so enthusiastic about the upcoming podcast episode they’ve been working on. Her storytelling always has a way of cheering me up. She has this knack for turning even the simplest events into something gripping.

Oh, you’ll love this—Chloé and I had an open-air vocal practice earlier at the Rosewood Theater. Honestly, it was like something out of a dream. Her singing, combined with the beautiful surroundings, was just magical. I tried to capture it in my sketches; there's so much warmth and energy in nature that really adds to the creative process. It feels like we blend our talents seamlessly, her voice painting the air with colors my hands try to catch on paper.

As always, we had those in-between moments filled with shared laughter and playful teasing. It’s days like these that remind me how lucky I am to have such wonderful friends. By the end of our session, we sat down and reminisced about our past collaborations. It's such a wonderful feeling to be part of a creative journey with someone who understands and complements your passion.

Before I sign off, there’s something I’ve been pondering—lately, I've found myself more drawn to combining my dental work with art. Weird, right? But think about it, the precision required in both fields overlaps so much. Maybe I could explore some new technique or project that merges the two. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. You always have the best ideas and feedback.

Alright, I need to wrap this up. Today has been rejuvenating, and sharing these little tidbits with you feels like the cherry on top. I’m heading to bed now, feeling quite fulfilled but a tad sleepy. 

**I need to get back to work. Catch you later!**
