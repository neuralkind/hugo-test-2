Hey there! I just had the most rejuvenating and creative day, and I couldn't wait to share it with you. It's one of those days where you feel like everything aligns perfectly, you know?

So, I spent the morning sketching by the Han River, and let me tell you, the autumn foliage is at its peak beauty. It was one of those crisp, serene mornings where the world feels almost too beautiful to capture on paper. The sun was just peeking over the horizon, casting these long, golden shadows that played perfectly with the vibrant reds and oranges of the leaves. I found this quiet spot near a willow tree and just let my mind wander while my hand tried to keep up. There's something so meditative about sketching outdoors—it really clears the mind.

Oh, by the way, as I was sketching, a little girl came up to me with her mom. She was fascinated by my drawings, and she asked if she could have one. Of course, I was more than happy to give her a quick sketch I did of a bird. Her eyes lit up, and she gave me the sweetest smile. Moments like that make everything worthwhile.

After sketching, I headed over to the Incheon Ceramics Studio for a workshop with JiYong Choi. You know how much I adore ceramics, and JiYong is just a genius with the craft. Today, he showed me this innovative technique involving bamboo strands. When the clay is fired in the kiln, the bamboo burns away, leaving intricate patterns behind. It’s like nature collaborating with art. We had so much fun experimenting with it. There were moments where we laughed at our silly mistakes, but in the end, we created some intriguing pieces.

I also had a bit of a chat with JiYong about future projects. It got me thinking about how much our creative processes have evolved since we first started working together. There’s a certain magic in revisiting old techniques with a fresh perspective, don't you think? Anyway, I'm super excited to see how our pieces turn out once they're fired. I wish I could show them to you right now!

Speaking of art, Chloé mentioned combining yoga and sketching by the Han River sometime. That sounds like a perfect blend of mindfulness and creativity, right? Maybe you could join us! It would be a nice little gathering.

As much as I enjoyed the ceramics workshop, the highlight of my day was, hands down, my cello practice this evening. I had this sudden burst of motivation and decided to dive into some of the more challenging pieces I've been meaning to practice. There's something incredibly satisfying about those rare moments when your fingers just know exactly where to go on the strings. The studio felt especially cozy tonight, with the golden twilight filtering through the window and casting a warm glow on my sketches hanging on the walls. 

I think I've fallen even more in love with my cello. You remember how it was a gift from a dear friend, right? It's like the instrument itself holds so many memories and pieces of my journey. I really tried to channel all those emotions into my playing today. There were these moments of sheer joy when the music just flowed effortlessly. It's almost therapeutic. I felt a bit rusty at first, but by the end, I was lost in the melodies.

You know, I was thinking about how much I appreciate these quiet, creative moments. Between the hustle at the dental clinic and social engagements, it's these pockets of time that really help me recharge. Have you had any moments like that recently? Those little slices of life that just make everything seem worthwhile?

Oh, you know what else? I was thinking about our last conversation and how you mentioned wanting to start a new hobby. Have you made any progress on that? I'd love to hear about it. You always have the most fascinating ideas and it’s so inspiring.

Before I forget, I talked to Neha and Andrew today. They had this amazing brainstorming session over chai, blending their cultural folk tales. I can only imagine the stories they came up with. It's always heartwarming to see our friends dive so deep into their creative passions.

And you know what? JungKyu has his poetry recital tonight. I'm so proud of him. His words always have such an impact. I hope his nerves don't get the best of him. We're all cheering him on, of course. I can't wait to hear how it went.

Oh, and speaking of poetry and art, ever thought about a collaborative project sometime? Maybe we could blend our talents and create something unique. It's just a thought, but it could be a lot of fun. What do you think?

Anyway, I should probably get back to organizing my studio a bit. It looks like a creative tornado hit it. But hey, that's the sign of a productive day, right?**

Catch you later!
