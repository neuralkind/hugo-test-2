Hey there! 

I just had to share some highlights from today with you. You know how my mornings usually start – yoga and meditation. Well, today was extra special. The sunrise was breathtaking, painting the sky with these unbelievable shades of coral and gold. There's something about watching the city wake up while I’m grounded in my yoga that just… I don't even know how to describe it. It felt like everything aligned perfectly.

I also spent a chunk of my afternoon at the Gwangalli Beach café – you remember that place, right? It’s the same charming spot we used to visit back during our university days. It always brings back a surge of memories. Today, though, I wasn’t just there to soak up nostalgia. I was working on my historical fiction project. The ambiance? Absolutely perfect. The café was filled with the inviting aroma of freshly baked pastries, and every sip of green tea was a gentle nod to childhood memories. Seriously, you would’ve loved it.

And when I think about it, there’s something almost magical in how these places keep their energy. Like, sitting there by the window with my journal, the gentle hum of the ocean in the background…it was as if the past and present seamlessly intertwined. Each word I scribbled down seemed to flow more naturally, the characters almost writing themselves. Ever get that feeling? Where inspiration just blossoms out of the blue?

Oh, by the way, before I get too deep into my ramblings, I caught up with our group this morning. Everyone’s doing such creative stuff. Seohee’s been really into her sketching sessions lately. She even mentioned doing one by the Han River, capturing the autumn vibes. Isn’t that picturesque? And you know JungKyu, always the early bird, also did meditation by the river. All these creative and mindful activities everyone’s involved in - it’s so motivating!

I had a lovely chat with Andrew and Neha as well. They’ve been bouncing some incredible folklore ideas for their podcast. Andrew has this knack for weaving stories that feel both familiar and entirely fresh. I can’t wait to hear what they come up with. The idea of combining bayou tales with Korean folklore is so intriguing, don’t you think? It really emphasizes how blending different cultures can create something truly unique.

Speaking of inspiration, you won’t believe how energized I felt after the beach café. The gentle sea breeze, the sound of waves – it all seemed to whisper old tales that wanted to be reborn. I found myself lost in the love stories, political intrigues, and heroic feats of yore. By the end of my writing session, I felt like I’d traveled through centuries in just a few hours. Oh, and I also bumped into one of our old classmates! Remember Min-Ji? She was there with her little daughter. It was such a sweet reunion. We reminisced about school days, and naturally, you came up quite a bit!

You know what’s funny? While I was engrossed in writing, I caught myself daydreaming about all those birdwatching mornings. There’s something meditative about it, don’t you think? Just standing there quietly, observing them reminds me of being at the park with a group of eager friends, the kind we met during that medical camp in Kathmandu. Every so often, I feel a pang for those simpler times, just widened by dreams and brimming with endless possibilities. 

Oh, and before I forget – Chloe texted me late in the evening. She just came back from a film festival. Vintage movies have a charm that’s hard to beat, and she sounded absolutely thrilled. I wish I could’ve joined her. Maybe we could all plan a movie night sometime and catch up on some classics? Her description was so evocative, it almost felt like I was there experiencing it too.

You know what also added a silver lining to my day? Seohee’s gentle suggestion of a story night where we share our narratives. I’m thinking maybe we could all pitch in with a tale or two, preferably when the vibes are just right, and let the evening fall around us. What do you think? It could be a fresh way to unwind and still stay creative.

I love how everyone in our circle is so engaged in such purposeful activities. Neha and JungKyu had their meetup at the Cozy Book Café, and it sounded like a smashing success. They mentioned getting deeply into historical debates. Can you imagine the kind of passion they must’ve sparked over cups of hot coffee? Even Andrew’s trip to Insadong Market seemed to brim with potential. Sometimes, these little pockets of cultural revelation hold the most profound stories waiting to be told.

Anyway, I won’t keep you for too long. I know these days get busy. But it’s incredibly comforting to share these snippets with you, and I hope they brought a smile to your face. Oh, and I did manage to wrap up my writing with a pleasant stroll – it was such a lovely way to end the day. **I need to get back to some work now, but I can’t wait to hear what you’ve been up to. Catch you later!**
