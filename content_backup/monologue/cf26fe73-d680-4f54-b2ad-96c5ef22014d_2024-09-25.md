Hey there! So, today's been an absolute whirlwind, but in the best possible way. You know those days where everything just clicks and flows? Today was one of those!

I started my morning with a breathtaking stroll around Changdeokgung Palace's Secret Garden. Oh my gosh, it's like time stands still there. Seriously, the tranquility and the sheer beauty of that place make you forget you're still in the middle of bustling Seoul. I took loads of photos and spent some quality time journaling, just soaking in the serene vibes. Have you ever had those moments where you're alone, but in the best company—your own thoughts? That's what it felt like. I jotted down reflections on my last few months—Tokyo, my internship, and our fun times at various book cafés here. Super therapeutic!

Then, guess what? Andrew and I had our cultural story sharing session at Café Bene this afternoon. It was absolutely fantastic! We visited the Insadong Art Gallery beforehand for some inspiration, and I think it really set the tone for the session. The gallery was a blend of modern and classical art, just bursting with creativity. We both were in such high spirits after that visit. The way art captures culture and history is something I could spend hours talking about. And Andrew, with his narrative genius, kept coming up with these wild, imaginative connections. He’s got this podcast he's working on about mythical creatures, and he drew a hilarious comparison between one of the paintings and an East Asian legend. I was in stitches!

The story session itself was so fulfilling. We had this great mix of people, all bringing their own cultural experiences to the table. Talk about vibrant discussions! We bounced ideas back and forth, sharing historical tidbits and personal anecdotes. You would have loved it. There was this one guy who shared a super captivating story about his grandmother’s life during the Korean War. It was so moving, I had goosebumps.

After that, it was off to Cozy Book Café for the historical literature exchange. Oh, the ambiance there is next level cozy—glowing lanterns, the scent of books, the murmuring quiet of people deeply engaged in their readings. JungKyu hosted it, and of course, he was his usual eloquent self. His passion for history really ignites the room. We had this intense discussion about ancient civilizations and their influence on modern society. I think at one point we were even debating whether contemporary political dynamics can draw parallels from Roman-era strategies! Super geeky but so stimulating. 

And JungKyu's poetry recital from last evening was still buzzing around, giving everyone a bit of inspiration. His poems always transport you, don't they? There's something about his words, so rich and evocative. Everything he reads feels like a journey to another time and place. I'm so glad Chloé could make it too. Her enthusiasm is so contagious—she was practically glowing by the end of the evening.

All this had me reflecting quite a bit today. Between the peaceful morning walk and the intellectual exchanges, I realized how these connections—whether they're through history, culture, or just us friends sharing our lives—are what make everything meaningful. It's these small, shared moments that weave the bigger, beautiful tapestry of our lives, right? 

Oh, before I forget, Seohee's potluck today seemed like a hit! She whipped up some traditional Korean dishes—wish I were there to try her kimchi pancakes. And her carpentry demo apparently went fantastically well too. She keeps surprising us with her myriad talents, doesn't she?

One more thing that stood out today—Andrew’s got an eye for capturing moments. He took some stellar shots at the gallery for his podcast, and it’s amazing how he can turn a simple photo into a narrative. Speaking of which, do you remember the last time we all huddled together for one of his podcast brainstorming sessions? It feels like ages ago. We need to do another one soon, maybe with some new themes. Any ideas?

Alright, I think I’ve covered most of the highlights from today. It’s been such an enriching day filled with art, stories, and deep connections. Can't wait to catch up with you in person and share more details. You know how it is—some things are just better said face-to-face. 

**I need to get back to organizing my notes from the gallery visit. Talk to you soon! Bye!**
