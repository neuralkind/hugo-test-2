Heyyy! Guess what? Today’s been a whirlwind. I had such an inspiring day, can’t wait to share it all with you!

So, I started my day with some yoga by the river. You know how I love those early morning sessions—they really clear my mind. There’s something about the flow of the river and the rustling leaves that just sets the perfect vibe for the day. I was totally in the zone, feeling the stretch, and grounding myself. It’s like, the best way to start off, you know?

After yoga, I hit this downtown café for a creativity hour. The atmosphere there was amazing. I grabbed a cozy little corner and decided to sketch out some new choreography ideas. The café was buzzing with such cool energy—writers typing away, artists scribbling in notebooks. It felt like the perfect place to get those creative juices flowing. I even managed to scribble down some song lyrics. You’d totally love it there!

Then, I joined Jesse for a dance workshop at his community art space. We combined French and Korean styles—like, imagine K-Pop meets contemporary dance. The turnout was awesome! There were so many eager faces, and the enthusiasm was just contagious. We had people dancing, laughing, and there was this one moment where we all did this synchronized jump... it actually looked really cool! You should’ve seen Jesse’s face; he was beaming! Can’t wait to see what more we can create together.

Oh, speaking of dance, I had a quick vocal practice with Seohee at the Rosewood Theater. Let me tell you, singing outdoors with her sketching nearby, capturing those moments—it felt magical. We even had a few curious onlookers stop by, and their reactions gave me such a boost. There’s just something so fulfilling about merging singing with visual art. Every note felt more vibrant, like it had an added dimension because of Seohee’s sketches.

And then, as if the day couldn't get any better, I ended with an evening nature walk at Seoul Forest. It was this perfect blend of colors in the sky—like a painter's palette exploded into the sunset. I took a few deep breaths, center myself again, and reflect on the day's activities. It’s funny how connecting with nature gives me such clarity, makes me feel more grounded and ready to tackle the next challenge.

By the way, there was this super intriguing art exhibit tonight! The Art Seoul Gallery hosted this fusion of Korean traditional and French avant-garde pieces. Walking through those halls, every piece screaming 'harmony in diversity,' I felt this deep connection to my roots and aspirations. I even met this artist who had created a piece around 'Harmony in Diversity,' a perfect representation of my journey, blending different influences into a captivating whole. It kinda felt like looking at a reflection of my own creative soul.

Oh, and you know how JiHoon and I can get totally absorbed in our discussions? Well, tonight we co-hosted this wellness and photography webinar. JiHoon’s photos are always so evocative, reflecting life's intricate beauty, and I got to pair his visuals with mindfulness exercises. The community's engagement was high—there’s just something special about integrating wellness with art that resonates deeply with people.

Wow, what a day. It felt like I was bouncing from one pocket of inspiration to another. Oh, by the way, JungKyu’s poetry recital was absolutely moving. His words transported us to another realm. And Neha loved it too, we exchanged such insightful thoughts afterward. We’re so grateful for these moments, these shared experiences, aren’t we?

Anyway, I’ve rambled on long enough, but it’s just one of those days, you know? Full of creative energy, really keeps the spirit alive, and I had to tell you all about it. Oh, before I forget, do you remember the tiny succulent you gifted me? It’s growing beautifully! Every time I water it, it reminds me of our friendship and all the incredible memories we’ve made. 

I need to get back to some choreography notes now. Talk soon?

**Catch you later!**
