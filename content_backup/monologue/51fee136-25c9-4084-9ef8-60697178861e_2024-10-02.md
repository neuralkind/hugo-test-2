Hey there! 

Oh man, today has been quite the adventure. It started early, as usual. I managed to drag myself out of bed for my morning routine at Yeouido Park. Felt like the autumn leaves were putting on a private show just for me. You can seriously get lost in those golden hues. I brought my journal along, of course, but I couldn’t help but just sit there for a bit, taking it all in. There’s something so grounding about that quiet morning space, you know?

You know what made me chuckle? While I was deep in a meditation trance, I overheard snippets of laughter from a group that was passing by. It reminded me of the spontaneous giggles we used to have back in Portland whenever we did our morning hikes. Sometimes those little echoes of the past just sneak up on you, don’t they? Anyway, after my usual bout of journaling, I felt ready to take on the day.

Late morning was a blast! Chloé invited me over for one of her culinary experiments, which, let me tell you, was a riot. She's got this knack for mixing flavors that I wouldn't even dream of putting together. Think of that time I tried cooking for you and ended up mixing paprika with cinnamon—well, this was like that, but successful. We had this hilarious moment where she was instructing me to flambé, and I nearly set the kitchen on fire. I can still hear her laughing about it. Definitely swiping a recipe or two for future reference.

After that culinary adventure, I swung by the Gwangalli Beach café. Chaeun had invited me over for a writing session. The view of the beach always stirs up some creative magic. Sitting there, with the ocean waves providing a steady rhythm, I found myself getting lost in a story idea that’s been bubbling for a while. There's this compelling energy she brings; it’s like every historical tidbit she shares adds a new brushstroke to the canvas of my thoughts. One minute you’re sipping tea, the next you’re transported back to a bygone era, envisioning characters that feel almost real. 

In the afternoon, I decided to stop by the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art. This place never ceases to amaze me. Each exhibit feels like a page from a storybook, waiting to be sketched into my journal. There was this exceptional installation that melded ambient sounds with dynamic visuals. I swear, closing my eyes for a moment and just letting the experience wash over me, it felt like I was standing inside a living painting. It’s one of those things you’d have to experience to truly get. My sketches from today feel different, almost like they’re infused with the essence of the museum itself. Can’t wait to show you next time we catch up.

You know what’s also cool? We had another one of those fantastic brainstorming sessions at the café. JiYong, Andrew, and Neha were there, and the ideas were just flowing. We were bouncing around everything from folklore adaptations to blending storytelling with art. I think you’d love some of the themes we came up with—they’re perfect for our next community project. We even touched on how to integrate some new art techniques into therapy. That’s definitely something I plan to follow up on. It always amazes me how these sessions breathe new life into my work.

Oh, and the evening was magic at Namsan Seoul Tower. The view from up there never gets old. Sketched a bit as the sun set, and the city lights began to twinkle on—it felt like I was capturing the heartbeat of Seoul on paper. There’s this serene quality to Namsan that almost feels like home, even amidst the bustling city. JiHoon and Haelim joined in as well, and we had this unspoken connection through our art. Seeing their different styles and how they interpret the cityscape is always so inspiring.

On a different note, I had a rather amusing mishap earlier. I decided to try out that new bamboo technique in ceramics, inspired by JiYong's workshop. Let's just say my clay creation ended up more like an abstract interpretation of a plant. Cracked everyone up when I showed them. I’m determined to get it right, though. If nothing else, it's fun embracing the unpredictability of art.

Before I forget, did I tell you about Chloé’s vocal practice at the Rosewood Theater? She was absolutely in her element, with Seohee sketching alongside her. It’s astounding to see how seamlessly they sync up. Sometimes, I think there's real magic in collaborations like that, where each person’s energy seems to amplify the other’s. Seohee’s sketches had this whimsical quality that seemed to echo in Chloé’s voice. It was a beautiful reminder of how our passions can resonate and inspire.

Finally, we’re planning a dinner get-together tonight. Gonna share our sketches and probably have a good laugh over today’s antics, especially my near kitchen disaster and that abstract bamboo plant. It’s these moments of connection that make everything else worthwhile, don’t you think? We’ll catch up soon, and I’ll fill you in on all the juicy details.

I need to get back to prepping for the dinner meet-up. Catch you later!
