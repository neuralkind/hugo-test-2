Hey there! I just had to tell you all about my day—it's been such a whirlwind, but in the best way possible! 

So, this morning started off with some much-needed "me" time. I went to Hanok Village for a bit of journaling and reflection. Honestly, being there with all those beautiful, historic houses just put me in this serene, contemplative mood. It got me thinking about everything that's happened over the last year, especially Tokyo and Busan—I still can't get over how each place has left its mark on my life. It was just the perfect way to ground myself and clear my head. You should try it sometime; I swear, it's better than meditation! 

Afterwards, I had brunch, and then it was time to meet up with Andrew for our folklore brainstorming session. Oh my goodness, it was beyond fun! We met at this cozy café, you know the one with fantastic chai lattes? I could sit there forever—it's like the place just radiates creative energy. Anyway, we dove into our folklore discussion, mixing stories from his culture and mine. We were bursting with ideas, like a tale about a resilient spirit navigating through various challenges. It was so cool to see how the elements from our backgrounds meshed together, like some kind of cultural tapestry. Honestly, brainstorming with Andrew is always inspiring. His story about his grandmother's old legend from Louisiana? Gave me chills. We're thinking of incorporating all these stories into his podcast. Imagine our tales being broadcasted! So exciting!

Oh, before I forget, I ran into Seohee and Jiyong today. They were coming out of the ceramics studio, and she showed me this beautiful vase she made. The bamboo technique Jiyong taught her really added an intricate touch—it's absolutely stunning. I swear, Seohee never fails to amaze me with her artistic flair; I wish I had half her talent with pottery. 

Then, the highlight of my evening—Chaeun and I hit the Leeum Art Gallery. First off, the artwork? Absolutely mind-blowing. There was this piece that really spoke to me, something about the color and form just captured my emotions perfectly. Chaeun was in her element too, taking notes and getting ideas for her next writing project. We had such a good time dissecting the pieces and talking about our favorites. I felt so inspired walking through the gallery; it's like the art had this electric charge that zapped me full of creative energy. I can't wait to channel all that inspiration into my own work.

Oh, and guess what? JungKyu has his poetry recital tonight! I know, right? I’m so excited and a little nervous for him. I’m heading over there soon, and we’ll all be there to cheer him on. His poems are always so moving, filled with insights from his travels. I’ll have to tell you how it goes. Hopefully, he nails it! I just know he will because he's so talented.

Now that I think about it, you know what Chloé said earlier about cooking for all of us? We should totally make that happen. Imagine a night of Chloé’s French-Korean fusion dishes, some drinks, and just us hanging out. Oh, and maybe Seohee can bring her cello to add some calm music vibes? It’d be such a perfect get-together. Let’s plan it? What do you think?

Anyway, I’m off now to get ready for JungKyu's recital. Fingers crossed for him! I can't wait to catch up with you again and hear about your day too. You always have the best stories.

Talk soon! Bye!
