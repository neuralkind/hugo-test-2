Hey!

I just had to share about my day because it’s been one of those perfectly serene yet wonderfully adventurous days. I started off with my usual yoga routine in the garden early in the morning. The sunrise was absolutely breathtaking—Seoul just comes alive in the morning, you know? The dew was still fresh on the grass and the bamboo was swaying gently. It felt like the world was whispering its secrets to me. Trust me, it’s the best way to collect your thoughts and set the tone for the day. You should try joining me one of these mornings!

Afterward, I settled into a cozy nook at Gwangalli Beach café to work on my historical fiction project. The ambiance was just perfect—imagine the gentle lapping of waves, the distant chatter of people enjoying their morning, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air. It brought back so many memories from our trips there. I found myself completely immersed in weaving historical tales, inspired by the stories my grandmother used to tell. There's something magical about this place that makes history feel alive. Oh, and the green tea there is to die for! Made me think how much you’d love it.

In the afternoon, I met up with Jesse for some birdwatching at Cheonggyecheon Stream. You know how much I adore these little escapes into nature. We strolled along the trails, caught up on each other’s lives, and spotted the most beautiful Mandarin duck. Its plumage was so vibrant, almost like an artist had painted each feather. Jesse was sketching like crazy—he's truly gifted. We found a quiet spot and just soaked in the serenity. It was one of those moments where everything feels perfectly aligned, like the universe is giving you a warm hug. We reminisced about our last birdwatching trip, which made me realize how much I treasure these simple yet profound moments.

Oh, and before I forget, the evening got even better—after birdwatching, I headed to the Cozy Book Café for JungKyu’s poetry recital. His words transported us all over the world... it was enchanting. There’s something so moving about sharing these creative moments with friends. The café was buzzing with so much energy, and everyone was so supportive. By the end of it, I felt so uplifted and inspired.

You know, this whole day just reminded me of how important it is to find joy in the little things and to surround yourself with people who inspire you. It made me think of all our moments together—the laughs, the deep conversations, the adventures. I’m just so grateful for these connections. Can’t wait until we get to have another catch-up session ourselves. We have so much to talk about!

Okay, enough of my rambling. How was your day? Catch you later!
