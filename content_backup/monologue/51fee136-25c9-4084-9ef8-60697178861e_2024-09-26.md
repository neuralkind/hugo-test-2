Hey there! 

So, today was a rollercoaster of creativity and fun. You know how much I love starting the day with some mindfulness, right? This morning, I ended up in Yeouido Park with my journal. It was one of those crisp, golden mornings where everything just feels right. I found this perfect little bench under a cluster of maples, the sunlight trickling through the leaves, just begging to be sketched. I couldn’t resist, so I got my journal out and just let the thoughts flow. It’s amazing how much clarity you can find in those quiet moments, surrounded by nature. Felt like time stood still for a while.

Soon after that, I headed over to the Rosewood Theater. Oh man, what an inspiring session with Chloé! She was practicing her vocals while Seohee was sketching the scene around us. It was like witnessing a perfect fusion of different art forms coming to life. Chloé’s voice was incredible, and you could see Seohee’s sketches bringing a whole new dimension to the performance. The synergy was just magical. I joined in on the conversation between their breaks—lots of laughter and creative banter. Such a fulfilling morning, really made my heart happy.

After a bit more journaling back home, I met up with Chaeun for this evening tea and art collab at Hanok Tea House. We perched ourselves in a cozy corner, sipping on some steaming green tea while sharing our latest sketches. The ambiance there is just so soothing. It has this old-world charm that makes everything feel timeless. The tea, the art, the conversation—it was all so enriching. We even brainstormed a bit for our next community project. You know, just bouncing ideas off each other, seeing where our visions intersect.

Oh, speaking of art, before I forget, I paid a visit to the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art as well. The exhibitions were absolutely breathtaking. There was this one multimedia installation that blended visual art with ambient soundscapes. I stood there, eyes closed for a bit, letting the sounds and visuals merge into my thoughts. I think it’s going to inspire a whole new series of sketches for me. One of those moments that reminds you why you love creating art; it was invigorating.

Later, I joined JiHoon's poetry session by the Han River. I could only make it in spirit, but it’s always inspiring to be connected to that creative energy, even remotely. His poetry sessions are something else—such a mellow way to wind down after a long day of creativity. 

And, can you believe Andrew hosted a cultural cuisine gathering with some delicious Indian recipes? His place must’ve smelled amazing. Made me think maybe we should try out a new recipe together sometime. Would be fun, right?

Anyway, I hope your day was as rich and rewarding as mine. The new coffee table JiYong crafted sounds pretty impressive, doesn't it? That guy never ceases to amaze.

By the way, we have a virtual art discussion coming up soon. If you’re free, it’d be awesome if you could join. JiHoon's planning something really cool, and it’s always better with more creative minds in the mix.

Oh, before I sign off, a little funny moment from earlier – I accidentally dripped some paint on my favorite sweater while sketching at the museum. Classic me, right? Guess it adds to the 'artistic' look, haha.

I should get back to finishing up some late-night sketches. Let's catch up soon. Bye!
