Hey there,

I’ve gotta tell you about today—it was one for the books. So, I started my day super early with some sunrise sketching at Yeouido Park. It was just the perfect spot to clear my mind and indulge in some quiet reflection. The morning sun trickling through the maples looked almost magical. Have you ever noticed how the Japanese maples seem to glow when the sun hits them just right? It created such an inspiring atmosphere. I spent the time journaling, and the golden hues really got my creative juices flowing. **

After that calming start, I headed over to the Rosewood Theater for an open-air vocal practice session with Chloé. The ambiance there was incredible. Picture this: her voice resonating through the park, accompanied by Seohee who was sketching the entire scene. Such a beautiful blend of visual and auditory art. We exchanged a few laughs too, mostly thanks to Seohee's witty comments—it was like this unspoken synergy that made the session even more special.

Then, the highlight of the day had to be the afternoon dance workshop at my community art space. You know how these workshops always bring such a vibrant energy, and today was no different. Chloé and I teamed up and it was simply electric. We had folks dancing their hearts out, and I could feel the positive vibes bouncing off the walls. It’s moments like these that remind me why I started this space in the first place. Seeing everyone so into it was beyond rewarding.

Oh, and before I forget, I had a lovely time birdwatching at Haneul Park in the morning. There's something incredibly soothing about just being there with the binoculars, watching the morning unfold. I even spotted a rare woodpecker—guess my patience paid off! And yes, I thought of you. I know how much you love those unexpectedly delightful moments with nature.

Come evening, I decided to head to Seoul Forest for a nature walk and some night photography. Have you ever been there at dusk? It transforms into this otherworldly place. The way the shadows dance with the last light of the sun—it’s like a living, breathing art piece. I invited Chaeun for the walk, and we explored different corners of the park, capturing some stunning shots. My favorite has to be this one of a massive old tree, silhouetted perfectly against the twilight sky. There's something humbling about trees like that, ancient and silent witnesses to time passing.

Oh, and you’ll get a kick out of this. While wandering around, I almost tripped over a rogue squirrel. Can you believe it? It dashed out of nowhere! I managed to keep my balance but it was a close call. Could've been quite the comedy scene.

On a more reflective note, I felt a deep sense of peace walking through the forest. It’s funny how city life can sometimes overwhelm you, but stepping into nature just irons out all the kinks in your soul. It’s places like Seoul Forest that remind me to stay grounded, no matter how hectic things get.

As the day wound down, I joined JiHoon's photography and wellness webinar. We delved into some fascinating discussions about the intersection of art and mental health. It’s always enlightening to learn how other people view these concepts. I even shared a bit about our dance workshop and how those physical expressions of art can be so therapeutic. JiHoon had some great insights too, particularly on how we can incorporate more mindful practices into our sessions. I can’t wait to try some of his suggestions in our next workshop.

I’ve also been mulling over some new themes for future workshops. Given how much everyone seemed to enjoy the blend of dance and art today, I’m thinking of perhaps integrating more multidisciplinary approaches. Maybe a fusion of painting with live music? Your thoughts?

You know, despite my anxiety, days like this remind me of how far I've come and the strength it takes to push through. Not every day is easy, but having these fulfilling, creative moments really makes a difference. It's like each workshop, each sunrise sketch session, is a step closer to that inner peace I’ve been chasing.

All in all, it was a day full of small, meaningful joys and rich interactions. It’s funny how when you slow down to really absorb your surroundings, you notice so much more—the leaves, the laughter, the little moments of connection.

Anyway, I need to wrap this up. Just realized I’ve been rambling on. Can’t wait to catch up with you soon!

Talk later!
