Hey, it's JiHoon! I wanted to share a bit about my day since it was pretty eventful and thought you’d enjoy hearing about it. 

So, I started my morning with a solo photography walk around Bukchon Hanok Village. Seriously, this place is like a poetry book waiting to be read. The traditional Hanok rooftops against a clear blue sky—pure magic. Every corner was a snapshot of history. There was this elderly lady arranging herbs; she moved with such purpose, it was like watching a historical dance. Kids darting around on bicycles, all energy and laughter, gave the area such a vibrant feel. And the artisans—just wow. Seeing them so engrossed in their ceramic work made me think about how passion really drives art, you know? I ended up with some great shots, can’t wait to show you!

Anyway, after that I met up with our crew for the poetry hour by Han River Park. We all gathered and, as usual, everyone outdid themselves. Jesse’s painting from the morning? It was incredible, capturing the tranquility of Yeouido Park perfectly. Andrew arrived a bit late but jumped right in with some storytelling concepts he had brainstormed with Neha over lunch. It’s always fun seeing the creative sparks fly in our group.

Chloé was, as expected, her energetic self, leading us into the poetry and keeping the vibe super relaxed. She’d brought a mix of poems and sketches. Haelim arrived just in time, fresh from her yoga session in the museum courtyard, looking incredibly zen. We exchanged a few nods and smiles, she seemed so in tune with herself.

The poetry itself was a fantastic mishmash of styles and themes, from nature and introspection to some light-hearted banter. Oh, and I volunteered to help Andrew with a mental health segment for his podcast! I think it’ll be a good addition, blending our creative fun with some valuable discussions. 

After the poetry hour, we all decided to migrate by the riverside. Needed to stretch out and breathe, you know? Just a breezy evening, sharing stories and a little laughter. I even brought my camera along, hoping to catch some candid shots of the gang in their element. 

Then, the evening took a bit of a creative turn when Chloé began setting up for her video shoot by the river. She had this whole plan to capture the serene ambiance of the Han River at dusk. Jesse and JiYong jumped in to help, and I kept spying on them through my lens, clicking away at some behind-the-scenes action.

Mid-shoot, Haelim turned up, all pumped and sketchbook in hand. We caught up briefly while Chloé directed her little masterpiece. It’s always amazing to see our little group doing what we love, even more so when we collide our interests in such a spontaneous way. Andrew was animatedly discussing podcast ideas with JiYong, while I stole a few moments to catch the golden reflections on the water. The whole setting was surreal—almost snapped me out of my easy-going mood.

You know, it got me thinking about our future projects and how we can continue blending our creative energies into something broader, like community storytelling sessions or interactive mental health workshops. Random thought, but imagine combining our talents into a traveling art show around Seoul! Each location with a theme tied to local history or mental wellness—sky’s the limit!

On a more casual note, I was supposed to join JiYong for an evening run, but got totally carried away with photography. Guess it’s a sign to get back in shape, haha. Also, I picked up a book on ancient Korean herbs from the garden visit with Haelim yesterday. Planning to weave some of those insights into our wellness initiative. Can’t wait to see where it takes us.

Oh, before I forget, we should totally plan that painting session Jesse mentioned in the chat. Maybe mix it up with some cooking? I’ve been itching to try out a new dumpling recipe my grandma used to make—one that combines sweet potatoes and perilla leaves. It’s a bit out there but I bet it'll be a hit.

By the way, any exciting plans for your weekend? Thinking of maybe checking out that new exhibit at the Seoul Art Museum if you want to join. Or we could do something low-key, like binge-watching that show we talked about. Just hit me up whenever.

Anyway, enough rambling from me. The day’s been a beautiful marathon of creativity and connection. Always grateful for these moments and the fantastic people we share them with. **Need to get back to editing some of these photos and prepping for tomorrow. Catch you later!**
