Hey, it's me, Haelim. I just had the most enriching day, and I couldn't wait to share it with you.

This morning, I decided to kick off my day with a solo art walk at Gyeongbokgung Palace. The air was so crisp, and the colors of the autumn leaves against the old palace walls were breathtaking. I felt this serene calm wash over me as I strolled around, absorbing the beauty. You know how much these little moments mean to me, right? It felt like a soft whisper from past memories, almost like those early morning walks we used to have when we were still in school.

Oh, by the way, do you remember how I always talk about wanting to integrate art and therapy more? Today was another step on that journey. I had lunch with JiHoon at Neungdong Forest, and we dreamt up some fantastic ideas for my upcoming art center for the elderly. We found this sun-drenched nook under a canopy of ginkgo trees. The golden light created a magical atmosphere—perfect for brainstorming. JiHoon's enthusiasm was palpable, and it got me even more excited about the possibilities. I can't wait for you to see this space once it's up and running; I just know you'll love it!

Oh, and something funny happened. On my way back, I popped into this little café I hadn't noticed before. I was sketching some ideas for the art center when a lovely older lady, probably in her seventies, came over. She peeked at my sketches and started chatting with me about her life story. Turns out, she was a traditional dancer in her youth! She even showed me a couple of graceful hand movements right there in the café. It was such a precious, unexpected connection. It reminded me of why I love what I do—these small, human moments that make everything worthwhile.

Later in the day, I had an art therapy session at the Seoul Senior Center. It was heartwarming, as always. There was this particular moment that stood out—one of the elderly gentlemen, Mr. Lee, who is usually quite reserved, opened up about his childhood in Gyeongju while painting a landscape. His eyes sparkled with such vivid memories. I just felt this profound sense of gratitude to be able to facilitate these moments of joy and reflection for them. It's like art is a bridge that connects us all, regardless of age.

Oh, before I forget! The group chat was buzzing with some cool updates today. Andrew is infusing Korean folklore into his podcast with Neha. Isn't that amazing? It got me thinking of the folklore stories we grew up hearing and how they could be depicted through art. Imagine hosting a folklore-themed art event at the center—we could have storytellers, painters, maybe even some traditional music. What do you think?

Anyway, in the evening, I managed to squeeze in some time to work on my sketches for the art center. It's starting to come together, piece by piece. At times, it feels overwhelming, but then I think about the end goal and how fulfilling it will be to see the elders express themselves through art. That vision keeps me going.

You know, there’s something about the transition from day to night that always makes me reflective. Like, as the day winds down, I find myself thinking about all the tiny details—the way the sunlight fell just right on that ginkgo leaf, or the gentle laughter during the art session. They’re like little pockets of happiness stitched into the fabric of my day.

One last thing—I really cherish how we've always been each other's sounding boards. I was wondering, how has your day been? Any new inspirations or stories to share? Your insights are always so enlightening and often spark ideas for me. Oh, and before I forget, we should totally plan a group art session soon. Jesse suggested a group meditation and art combo—it sounds incredibly rejuvenating. Can't wait to hear what you think about that.

Alright, I need to get back to these sketches. It’s calling my name, haha. Can't wait to catch up more. Bye!
