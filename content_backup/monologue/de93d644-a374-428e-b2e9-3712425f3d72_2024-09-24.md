Hey there! 

Just wanted to drop by and share a bit about my day—it’s been quite a rollercoaster in the best possible way. So, my day kicked off with the most serene morning meditation by the Han River. I mean, the colors of the sunrise were simply—otherworldly. Imagine the sky gradually transitioning from a sleepy purplish hue to a vibrant pink and then a warm golden light. It felt like the universe was painting with its own palette. I could literally feel my mind uncluttering with each breath, syncing perfectly with the gentle waves. Ever since my trip to Paris, where I practiced those meditation sessions in the lush parks, I’ve found them so reviving, almost like hitting the reset button. You really have to join me next time; it’s such a great way to start the day, especially with all the creative plans we’ve been talking about.

Oh, by the way, after that soul-refreshing meditation, I headed straight to the Seoul Senior Center for an art therapy session with JungKyu. You remember him, right? The guy with the enchanting voice? Well, today, he was in top form, weaving his poetry through the air as we guided the elderly participants in painting cherry blossoms. It's heartwarming to see their faces light up, the room filled with laughter and creative energy. You can really feel the power of companionship and creativity healing just about anything. It’s honestly one of the most fulfilling parts of my week, watching them open up through art. It makes me even more eager to get that community art center off the ground.

Later in the evening, I found myself sketching by the Namsan Tower. The sky was this perfect mix of twilight tones, and the tower stood tall, brilliant against the backdrop of the city lights. Sketching there made me think of the summers at my grandparents’ farm, the way I used to sketch the horizon, merging those rural memories with the urban vibe. It’s incredible how a pencil and paper can create a dialogue between past and present. There’s something profoundly therapeutic about translating those subtle whispers of the city into lines and shadows on paper. 

You know, it’s days like these that underline why I’m so passionate about combining art and caregiving. The intersection of these two realms brings such a unique sense of fulfillment. Today was a mosaic of all the things I love—nature, art, and human connection. It’s funny, sometimes I think about how my public speaking anxiety contrasts with how relaxed and invigorated I feel in these one-on-one or intimate group settings. There’s a certain magic in small, meaningful interactions, don’t you think?

Oh, before I forget, I ran into JiYong and Andrew discussing their café design project today. I overheard them talking about integrating storytelling elements with the café’s aesthetics—sounds like it’s going to be a place worth visiting! I love how our friends are always creating, always pushing the boundaries of their craft. And speaking of friends, I hope Jesse’s workshop went well today. You know how his energy can just light up a room.

I did find a quiet moment to sketch after everything. The city felt so alive tonight, despite the calm. There's something about observing people moving through their lives, living their stories. It reminds me why I do what I do—each person, each interaction is a narrative waiting to be captured, understood, and cherished.

And hey, I’ve been mulling over that idea we talked about last week—the traveling art exhibition featuring works from elderly artists. I think it could be a beautiful way to blend our love for art and our dedication to elder care. Imagine it: art from different neighborhoods, telling the diverse stories of aging gracefully in Seoul. Wouldn’t that be something?

Alright, I should probably wrap this up. I’ve got some planning to do for tomorrow’s sessions, and my sketchbook is calling me. Can't wait to hear about your day. 

**I need to get back to work. Catch you later!**
