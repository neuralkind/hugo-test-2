Hey there, buddy!

Man, you wouldn't believe the morning I had. So, I kicked off the day with a solo sunrise photography session at Namsan Park. You know how much I love those quiet, early hours when the world feels like it's just waking up alongside you. The park was absolutely stunning, covered in this beautiful, ethereal mist that made everything look like it was draped in a soft, dreamy veil. I managed to get some killer shots—one in particular of the sun just peeking over the horizon through the trees, with the light dappling on the dew-covered grass. I’m thinking some of these might actually make it to my podcast covers. What do you reckon?

After soaking in the tranquility of the park, I headed to my favorite local café for a brainstorming session with Neha. Man, that was a blast! We were there for a couple of hours just bouncing ideas off each other. Neha suggested incorporating some Korean folklore into my stories, and let me tell you, that was a game-changer. We were scribbling so many notes that at one point, I felt like my hand might cramp up! But in the best way, you know? Now, I’ve got this burgeoning idea for a tale about a spirit that protects an ancient forest, drawing on both Korean and Louisiana legends. I can’t wait to start writing it out fully.

Oh, and get this—I had a café meetup with JiYong later in the day. We chatted about his dream project, this beachside café he’s been sketching out for ages now. I threw in some ideas for a live storytelling session there once it’s up and running. Picture it: relaxing by the sea, with a drink in hand, while I weave a string of tales—sounds like paradise, right? JiYong loved the idea, and we spent a good chunk of time just envisioning the place, down to the last detail. The collaboration felt so electric. Makes me excited thinking about all the possibilities we can create together!

Oh, by the way, I also squeezed in a quick visit to the Insadong Art Gallery with Neha. The art exhibit was breathtaking, as always. I found myself lost in this giant abstract piece that seemed to ripple with emotion. Neha and I had such a fun time theorizing about the stories behind each artwork. It was like putting together a jigsaw puzzle but with colors and emotions. I even snapped a few pics for inspiration—maybe these will give me a fresh perspective for the podcast too.

Before I forget, I’ve been working on some script writing tonight. Got really inspired by everything today, and it felt right to channel that energy into some good old storytelling. You know that feeling when the words just flow, and you lose track of time? Yeah, it was one of those sessions. I think the tales we brainstormed today have some real potential. I’ll definitely need your feedback on them once I’ve got a draft ready. Maybe we can meet up over brunch next weekend at Café Seoyang? I mentioned it to the group, and it seems like everyone’s on board.

Oh, and gotta tell you about this funny moment at the café with JiYong. There was this skittish kitten that wandered in and started snuggling up to everyone’s legs, regardless of whether they wanted it or not. It was this fuzzy orange ball of energy, and before we knew it, the whole café was doting on it. Kinda reminded me of how people rally around during storytelling sessions—it's all warm and inclusive.

Anyway, it’s been an epic day, full of creativity and connections. I’m still buzzing from all the interactions and ideas. I hope your day was just as awesome. We definitely need to catch up soon. Got tons more to share, but I don't want to turn this into a novel.

Alright, I should probably get back to refining these script ideas. Catch you later, my friend. Bye!
