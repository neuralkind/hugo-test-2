Hey there! 

Just finished what turned out to be an absolutely invigorating day, and I wanted to catch you up on everything. You know, just a usual carpentry-filled morning for me, but today, it felt a bit more special. I got up early and headed straight into my workshop. I had this particular coffee table design in my head, inspired by Busan's coastline. Honestly, it turned out way better than I'd imagined. There was something about the way the light danced on the oak that made the entire process feel almost magical. You're going to love it when you see it. 

I was reluctant to tear myself away from the workshop, but I had some plans this afternoon. Oh, by the way, remember that group chat we had this morning? It was buzzing with everyone’s morning activities—Chloé with her yoga, Andrew's sunrise photography, Jesse painting, and JiHoon’s exploration of Bukchon Hanok Village. It seemed like we were all tapping into some creative energy today. Chloé even suggested a spontaneous tea and poetry hour later, which was an excellent idea. She has this knack for bringing people together in the most artistic ways.

So, I ended up joining that poetry session, and it was incredibly heartening. We gathered by Han River Park. The spot was perfect, serene yet buzzing with this subtle vibrancy. It started with Andrew being fashionably late, as usual, but better late than never. Jesse shared a poem inspired by his morning at the park, and it was so vivid—really pulled you into the moment, you know? 

Chloé, ever the organizer, kept the flow going. Each contribution was like a different brushstroke on a communal canvas. I read a piece about the coastal elegance and how being around such friends felt like having a home away from home. Quite moving, if I may say so myself, but it didn't hold a candle to some of the others. Haelim’s sketches were a showstopper. 

After the poetry hour wound down, we decided to stick around the riverside for a bit. The air was crisp, and the sun was beginning to set—perfect for a quick evening run. As always, my runs are where I do some of my best thinking. Today, it was more reflective than usual, maybe because of the creative vibe from earlier. Ever get that feeling where you're just in sync with everything around you? 

Anyway, post-run, I met back with Chloé and Jesse. They had a video shoot scheduled at the river, something for Chloé’s project. Naturally, I couldn't resist sticking around longer to see them work their magic. They've got this synergy—it’s quite inspiring to watch. I swear, as soon as the camera started rolling, everyone just fell into this effortless, creative rhythm. Kind of wish I had that ease in front of the camera.

JiHoon captured some fantastic behind-the-scenes shots—yes, with his ever-present camera. You know him, always prepared. Later, Haelim joined us after her yoga session at the courtyard. A bit late, but her timing was impeccable; the magic stuff was just beginning. I tell you, the view from the riverbank at night, framed by the city lights, with everyone so creatively alive around, is something else. You’ve got to experience it one of these days. 

And oh, small side story! Andrew and I had lunch today, and we brainstormed on some fantastic ideas for that dream beachside café I’ve been rambling on about forever. He channeled some of his storytelling magic from his New Orleans tales into conceptual designs. We even thought about a 'Stories Bench' where visitors could write and share their own little narratives. A cozy corner for everyone’s stories. Kinda cool, right? I can't wait to see these ideas come to life.

Oh, and before I forget, I bumped into Ms. Lee from the community center on my way back home. She was asking about you. Mentioned something about needing extra help with the next art therapy session. Maybe you could join? It’s always such a fulfilling experience—and we could use the extra pair of hands. 

One more thing—random, but it got me thinking during my run. You ever wonder how some days just align perfectly, like everything’s meant to be in harmony? Felt that way today, every small bit coming together. Kind of profound, isn’t it?

Anyway, enough rambling from me. Today was filled with so much creativity and reflection; it’s nice to end it with you, even if it’s just a voice message. Seems like Seoul is shining on us with these beautiful, artistic vibes. 

Talk soon, and let me know if you can join in for the next poetry session or perhaps that art therapy. Hope your day was fantastic too. Oh, and if you get a chance, check out the pictures JiHoon posted from Hanok Village. Truly captures the beauty of our history—might inspire you.

Catch you later!
