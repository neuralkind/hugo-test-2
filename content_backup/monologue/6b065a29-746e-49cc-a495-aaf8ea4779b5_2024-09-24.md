Hey there!

So, I had quite an eventful morning today. I went on a photography walk at Bukchon Hanok Village, and let me tell you, it was like stepping back in time. The Hanoks, with their traditional tiled rooftops, are just as picturesque as ever. Each house there feels like it has its own story to tell. I couldn’t help but imagine what life must have been like back in the day for the people who lived there. Oh, and the ginkgo trees—some of the leaves are starting to turn this gorgeous shade of gold. Seriously, it was like nature was trying to show off a bit.

You know those moments when you’re just in your own world, and something simple happens that makes the whole experience even more magical? That was me, standing there with my camera, hearing the faint sounds of kids laughing as they zoomed past on their bikes and elderly sellers arranging herbs at their stalls. It felt like I was capturing snippets of lives woven together by these daily rituals. I managed to get some amazing shots, and I can’t wait to show them to you.

I had an interesting thought while I was there, too. With all these photographs I’m gathering, I’ve been noodling on the idea of using them to promote mental health. Like, combining visuals that evoke a sense of peace and mindfulness with messages about wellness. Sounds a bit lofty, right? But I think it could really resonate with people. I mean, who wouldn’t want to take a mental break by looking at serene pictures and getting some good vibes along the way?

Anyway, after that little escapade, I wrapped up a quick lunch and dove into a whirlwind of creative exchanges with our usual gang. I swear, today felt like a hive of inspiration buzzing around us. Everyone seemed to be on their game—Andrew’s got some pretty neat ideas for his storytelling project with JiYong, blending Korean folk elements. And Chloé? She’s got this infectious energy that’s like the secret sauce to any creative project. Who knew that a community art space could have such transformative vibes?

Oh, before I forget, Jesse’s workshop today sounded like it was incredible. Chloé mentioned that integrating her artistic choreography really gave the whole event a unique twist. Then there’s JiYong, who just finished up his ceramics session with Seohee, and from what I heard, they’ve created some masterpieces. Can’t help but feel a bit envious, in a good way, of course. 

You know what’s funny? Just thinking about everyone’s different projects and passions today makes me appreciate how creativity is like this invisible thread connecting us all. Maybe that’s why I love hanging out with this crew so much. It's just a constant flow of inspiration and shared joy.

Anyway, in the spirit of keeping things interesting, I had a pretty hilarious moment in the afternoon. Picture this: I’m on my way to my next appointment, and out of nowhere, this little kid, probably about five years old, just bolts across the park with a paper plane. He’s laughing like it’s the most fun he’s ever had, and of course, I end up snagging a candid shot of him mid-flight. The joy on his face was pure gold. Reminded me of us chasing kites and getting up to all sorts of antics back in the day. 

After my rounds at the hospital, I did a little wrap-up and guess what? The team there’s starting to warm up to the idea of integrating more holistic approaches into patient care. Baby steps, but you know me, I’m all about planting those seeds. Today felt like it had that extra layer of promise, like the kind you get from a beautiful sunrise. 

I was also thinking about our next hangout session. Maybe we could do something different? How about a low-key get-together at that riverside spot we found last year? I reckon bringing everyone’s art and photography together would make for one epic evening. Can you imagine? Art, good conversation, maybe even some live music if we get lucky with street performers. Just an idea, but I think it could be a blast.

And oh, speaking of fun, you’ll never guess what I found while tidying up my room last night—old sketches from our high school days. The ones where we dreamed up those crazy business ideas and imaginary vacations. Seriously, I had to laugh at some of them. We had such wild imaginations! Maybe we should add a nostalgic twist to our riverside hangout, bring a few old sketches to laugh over? 

Alright, I’d better wrap this up. Suddenly realizing I need to finish editing those Bukchon photos before the day’s done and dusted. But hey, it’s been great catching up, even if just through this message. Let’s make that riverside hangout happen soon, yeah? I’m all for more of these creatively charged, laughter-filled days.

I need to get back to work. Catch you later!
