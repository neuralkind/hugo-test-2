Hey there! You'll never guess what kind of day I had!
Today's activities have been a rollercoaster of excitement and creativity. So this morning, Felix and I hit the New York Space Society's Rocket Design Workshop. Let me tell you, there's something about being surrounded by the towering pines and the scent of fresh pine needles that gets your mind spinning with ideas. Maybe it was the crisp autumn air or the shared enthusiasm of everyone there—who knows? Felix was in his element, trying to sneak in little LED setups on our model with a mischievous glint in his eye.

We had this fantastic blueprint laid out, and oh man, the adrenaline of constructing something from scratch, you know what I mean? Those shiny tools were like toys to us—aluminum tubes scattered everywhere, blueprints fluttering around, and the satisfaction? Like sweet music when you finally see your design take shape. The entire experience was like a dance between science and art.

And just as I'm focused on aerodynamics, Felix cracks this joke about our model being the ‘spaghetti rocket’ because of how tangled our wires got. We laughed so much I think we startled a couple of bystanders. Our rocket ended up with some whimsical LED lights mimicking fiery propulsion. Not quite actual thrusters, but hey, we had the crowd imagining. The end goal—launch in unison to watch them light up the clear sky—that’s yet to happen, but wow, my mind is still buzzing from it.

Then, fast forward to the afternoon—an improv comedy show at the Uptown Theatre. Shifted gears from rockets to comedy and... can I just say, these performers were an outright riot? It's fascinating how things that seem so unpredictable and spontaneous can align so perfectly, kind of like how a constellation only makes sense when you see the whole picture, right? Their humor just turned corners you least expected, and somehow it felt like therapy, releasing those little pockets of stress one laughter burst at a time.

I found myself sitting there, basking under the warm lights of the theatre, feeling the edges of my usual worries soften with every punchline. For a couple of hours, everything was in this perfect balance—my laughter mixed with the crowd's, leaving an aftertaste of joy and a sense of freedom I hadn't realized I missed so much in all the hustle of academia and experimenting with rocket designs.

Oh, and before I get ahead of myself, this evening took on a new flavor at Leila’s apartment during the Culinary Cultural Night. Enter the realm of senses just buzzing with color and fragrance. I got tasked with making "Banh Xeo"—that was an event in itself. Imagine juggling shrimp, batter, and physics to create something cohesive. Let’s just say there might’ve been a bit of magic mingling with those pancake flips. Kind of amazed myself with how nicely they turned out!

We exchanged stories, each dish a reminder of somewhere or someone special, a meal that pulled the day together—different backgrounds heralding fun-filled conversations and adventures. The night felt like weaving threads of laughter and spices, each whispering its unique tale.
So where was I... right, the Culinary Cultural Night at Leila’s! Honestly, it's like stepping into a melting pot of cultures and flavors. It's amazing how food can sort of narrate the stories of entire cultures, right? There I was, elbow-deep into making "Báhn Xèo," trying not to set anything on fire while secretly testing out a bit of gravity magic to flip those pancakes just right. Not gonna lie, it was kind of exhilarating, like orchestrating the perfect symphony—adding shrimp, swirling batter, all while trying to keep it a surprise every time I twisted my wrist. Can you imagine explaining that one? "Oh, just a bit of telekinesis with your dinner."

Anyway, the buzz of conversation lingered in the air, carrying tales from every continent, each person sharing snippets from their own worlds. Leila's kitchen was a microcosm, really—like a refugee from a world fair, with everybody bringing something to the table. I ended up chatting with potential collaborators—a culinary-forward kind of techie—thinking maybe we should invent an app that bridges people using shared recipes from around the globe. Surely, you'd swipe more for a Bánh Xèo inspiration than any dating app, right?

Before I get sidetracked, let me just say, witnessing everyone’s culinary skills unfold was like watching a live art installation. Seeing people around me adding their favorite spices or cooking techniques—it just clicked that there’s this magic in the mundane stuff, too, the stuff we do every day that ties us universally. I swear, our senses went on a world tour without leaving Leila’s living room.

And you wouldn’t believe, mid-laughter, someone suggested launching an actual culinary satellite up there to beam recipes from stars! Imagine that—signals bouncing off Mars before hitting your kitchen counter. A cosmic cookbook. Suppose that's tech-meets-gastronomy right there, a bit sci-fi? Got me thinking, between my classmates and our recent experiments in drumming up satellites from mere sketches, this isn’t just wild imagination.

But as we smuggled bites between stories, there was this feeling, like we were all tethered to something bigger. You know, how even gravity bows to our ambitions and calls for discovery? Haha, maybe a bit dramatic or the remnants of some ridiculously good Bánh Xèo—totally outdid myself there.

And oh, here's a sprinkle from earlier! The improv show—can’t forget that, no way. Those performers spun on a dime, catching every odd suggestion the audience threw their way. Seriously, have you ever felt your sides split because a pirate squirrel teamed up with a time-traveling parrot, all while discussing philosophy? Totally relatable and a mood, right?

The laughter, I think, was what I needed most. Funny how those moments unravel your stress in such unexpected ways, almost like imagining tangled knots turning to smooth, loose threads. I reckon it's important to let go of all those calculated measures and let life spill over its edges sometimes, finding yourself a character in the most absurd yet fabulous comedy of errors—hey, maybe there’s a metaphor there for living life unapologetically.


You wouldn’t believe how effortlessly the evening unfolded at Leila's Culinary Cultural Night. It’s like, every dish had a story, and we were uncovering entire worlds on our plates. Leila herself was the guardian of spice tonight, her Moroccan stew an aromatic marvel. I swear, it whispered tales like the Mediterranean winds! And, speaking of whispers, I ended up sitting across from this group of culinary enthusiasts. Somehow, our conversation veered into a realm of creating an app merging global cuisines with tech. Think of it— an interstellar recipe exchange!

It's wild, I know. But sitting there, tasting Bobotie from South Africa one moment and then a slice of Moussaka from Greece the next, felt like orchestrating a cosmic symphony. Each mouthful carried a note, a story, a journey—think 'gastronomic symposium' with a hint of Julian flair, minus the toga parties... unless? Haha.

Anyway, while Felicia was discussing her first-ever attempt at making sushi (with a surprise spicy twist), I was reminded of how we all contribute unique spices to each other's lives, like threads woven into this surreal yet grounded tapestry. It got me reflecting on how culturally rich and mutually inspiring gatherings like these can be—simple yet so profoundly connecting. It kind of feeds that idealistic dreamer in me, y'know? Like, maybe we really can explore galaxies of human connection beyond just our immediate circles.

Oh, before I forget, the savory spotlight of the night was most certainly my audacious attempt at Bánh Xèo, spurred by a dash of gravity magic; let’s just say my culinary antics have reached new heights—literally. The way those pancakes flipped mid-air, landing with a bounce of mutual admiration amidst the herbs and spice aromas, was pure sensational sorcery.

And of course, laughter wasn’t in short supply either. As we exchanged stories, jokes, and banter—our tongues were as vivid as our taste palettes. It reminded me of the improv comedy show earlier, where the unexpected became brilliantly woven narratives that somehow made perfect sense—a string of chords in harmony. Life at that moment seemed like a delicious improv, constantly surprising us with its unexpected blends and spirited interactions.

Every sense in the room was engaged, from the clinking glasses to wafts of culinary aromas mingling through shared laughter. It almost felt like we were at the cusp of a great dance, though dances aren't quite my strong suit—thankfully, it’s the thought that counts, right? Sometimes it’s just magical to observe from a corner, learning a great deal from people throwing ingredients and ideas into the shared pot of our lives. 

So, yeah, no agenda, just the pure joy of seeing where curiosity and a tasty fusion of creativity would lead us. Leila’s apartment was like a microcosmic universe, with every ingredient a star, each story a galaxy. It's a reminder of why I love this city, its pulse, and the way we all become entwined in each other's lives, each adventure brimming with potential.
Anyway, just thought I'd share those little weaving tales. What's happening with you lately?
