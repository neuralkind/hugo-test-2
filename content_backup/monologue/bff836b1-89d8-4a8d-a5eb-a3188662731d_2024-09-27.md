Hey buddy, 

I wanted to catch you up on my day. You know those mornings where everything just feels right? It started quiet and calm. As the sun was peeking through, I was in my workshop, tinkering away at a new coffee table design. There’s something about the smell of fresh wood and the rhythm of the tools that just clears my mind. I was completely in the zone. Like, each cut and groove had me thinking about our times at the beach. I guess that connection between past and present always gets to me. Anyway, I added some elements inspired by our old beach trips – those waves we used to watch crashing against the rocks. You’d definitely see it if you were here. 

Oh, by the way, Andrew and I had this great chat about the café over coffee today. He’s got some brilliant ideas about storytelling corners and incorporating New Orleans tales. Imagine a cozy nook where people can share and listen to stories with coffee in hand. Kind of like a sanctuary for memories. Man, we could really make that place something special. We were sketching out layouts and envisioning it all coming together. He’s coming around to the idea of storytelling sessions, which would be amazing! We could even integrate some DIY carpentry workshops. Remember how we used to build stuff together? It’s almost like coming full circle.

Speaking of creativity, Chloé and I went to the Classic Film Festival this afternoon. The rain added this cozy, nostalgic vibe that was just perfect. We saw some old films that had this raw, unfiltered charm. It's like they had a soul, you know? Chloé was totally inspired for her music. We chatted about how the rustic feel of these vintage cinemas could influence our café’s atmosphere. Imagine a corner of the café dedicated to old movie posters and perhaps weekly film nights. I think that could attract some serious movie buffs and create a special niche for us.

After that, I swung by the Insadong Market with Andrew. That place is a goldmine of culture and inspiration. We walked through the art galleries, and the sheer creativity there was mind-blowing. Andrew’s always got these fascinating insights, connecting modern art with old tales and legends. We had this great laugh about a weird abstract piece that looked like a bayou monster. He’s planning to use that in his next podcast episode. We snapped tons of photos – you’d love the vibrant colors and textures there. So many ideas flowing, thought I'd share some with you next time we meet up.

Oh, and I stumbled upon this neat little shop selling handcrafted pieces—totally up our alley. They had these intricate wooden toys and small furniture that were just brilliant. It reminded me of when we used to mess around with wood in my uncle’s workshop, trying to create something out of nothing. Made me realize how much I want the café to feature local artisans' work too. Support the community, right?

Before I forget, Jesse’s been sketching up a storm. He mentioned he might try sketching some of the photos from Insadong. I can’t wait to see how they come out. His work is always so detailed and full of character. He’s definitely got the eye for capturing moments.

Listening to everyone talk about their morning routines in our chat really hit a chord. I love how each of us finds solace in different creative activities. Even though I prefer the quiet focus of my carpentry, it’s nice knowing we're all channeling our inspiration in various forms. Haelim’s been really into her art meditations too. She’s been creating these beautiful pieces that just reflect the essence of autumn. Can you imagine having her paintings displayed in our café? It would add such a unique touch.

On a different note, helping out at the Senior Center today was incredibly fulfilling for JiHoon. He’s got this way of brightening up any room with his energetic stories. It’s always rewarding seeing the smiles on the seniors’ faces. Reminds me of why we do what we do. Keeps us grounded, you know?

I guess that’s most of what went down today. It’s been a perfect blend of productivity and inspiration. Days like this, where creativity flows freely, really make me appreciate the path we’re on. A lot of pieces coming together, little by little.

You know what? We should plan to visit the Leeum Museum together. Jesse mentioned that the multimedia exhibit there is phenomenal. Might spark more ideas for us. Plus, it would be a blast exploring it as a group.

I think I've rambled enough for now. **I need to get back to working on that table. It's shaping up nicely, and I can't wait for you to see it. Catch you later.**
