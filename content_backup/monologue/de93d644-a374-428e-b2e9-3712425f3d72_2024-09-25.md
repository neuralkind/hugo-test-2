Hey there! It’s been a pretty eventful day, and I wanted to share some of the highlights with you. 

So, this morning, I went to Hangang Park to do some sketching. You know how much I love the river, right? Even though it was early, the air was so fresh, and it really helped me clear my mind. There’s something magical about watching the sunrise over the water; it just fills me with this calm, creative energy. I found this perfect spot where the trees create a natural frame for the river. It was like nature was setting up a little stage for me to draw. I managed to sketch a few quick studies of the trees and the reflections in the water. I swear, sometimes it feels like the river is whispering ideas directly into my sketchbook.

Oh, by the way, at lunch, Chloé and I went to the Samsung Museum of Art. Have you been there recently? The exhibits were just breathtaking! There was one installation, in particular, that involved hanging fabrics with intricate patterns—move over, everything else—I’m obsessed! It sparked so many ideas for our community art center. Imagine having an exhibit where the elderly can work on collaborative fabric arts. It would be an amazing blend of tradition and creativity. 

After the museum, I had a chance to join JiHoon at the Korean Herb Garden in Gangwon. We immersed ourselves in a mini-journey through ancient medicinal plants. It was fascinating! JiHoon was narrating tales about ginseng and other herbs that have been used through Korean history. His storytelling is always so captivating. I was sketching some of the herbs while he described their uses and history—kind of like a live illustration session. We even shared a little picnic under a pine tree. It was nice to slow down and really connect with nature. The place had this serene aura, making our conversations deeper and more reflective.

In the evening, I found myself at a cozy café in Itaewon, nestled in a corner with a perfect view of the cityscape at night. I decided to spend a couple of hours journaling and sketching the glowing skyline. Sitting there with a cup of herbal tea, I could see the city lights flicker like stars. It reminded me of those nights we used to spend at the beach, watching the waves crash under the moonlight. Anyway, I worked on a few sketches, trying to capture the city’s vibrancy and also reflect some of the tranquility I felt earlier in the day. It felt like I was weaving memories into my art, like stitching different threads of the day together.

While I was sketching, I couldn’t help but think about our dream for the community art center. It's becoming more vivid by the day. The ideas we've been tossing around are starting to feel more concrete. I can almost see it now—a place where everyone, especially the elderly, can come and express themselves through art, maybe even using some of the medicinal plants we learned about today in natural dyeing workshops. How cool would that be? Also, we could have storytelling sessions there. Imagine JiYong sharing his coastal legends while everyone sips herbal tea. The more I think about it, the more it feels like our dream is inching closer to reality.

Oh, and JiYong’s woodworking projects sounded so intriguing. I hope he shares some of his pieces with us soon. I told him I'd love to see his work someday, and maybe we can even incorporate it into our art center. Having beautifully crafted furniture and art pieces around would add so much character to the space.

JiHoon’s dance workshop with Chloé seemed like it went wonderfully. I checked in for a bit and their energy was infectious! It's fantastic to see everyone bringing their unique talents into the mix. It's like we’re all little pieces of a bigger puzzle, making something beautiful together.

Before I forget, I wanted to mention something funny that happened at the herb garden. We were trying to identify a particular plant, and JiHoon was so confident it was a specific herb he’d read about, only for the curator to casually correct us. We ended up laughing about it for a good five minutes. Ah, moments like these remind me that even amidst all the chaos, there's always room for a bit of light-hearted fun.

Okay, one last thing—I finally perfected that kimchi recipe I was working on! I know you’ve been patiently waiting for me to get it just right. I think I’ve nailed the balance between spicy and tangy. Promise I’ll bring some over next time we meet. 

Alright, I should probably wrap this up. The city lights are starting to blur as my eyelids get heavier. Today’s been one for the books—full of inspiration and moments that reminded me why I love what I do. We’ll catch up more soon.**

I need to get back to work. Catch you later!
