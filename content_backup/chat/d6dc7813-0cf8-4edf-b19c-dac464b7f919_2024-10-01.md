**Morning:**

**060831 Chloé:** Morning, guys!! Just finished an amazing sunrise yoga session by the Han River 🌄, feeling sooo zen right now. How’s everyone’s morning?

**061042 JiHoon:** Morning, Chloé! That sounds serene. I spent my morning capturing Bukchon Hanok Village through my lens 📷✨. Such a peaceful vibe.

**061348 Andrew:** Good morning! Your yoga sounds incredible, Chloé. I just came back from photographing Namsan Park at dawn. There's something magical about the city waking up!

**061627 Jesse:** Morning, everyone! Did my usual meditation at Yeouido Park today. The colors of the sunrise were so soothing. We should all do a group session sometime 💭🧘‍♂️.

**061810 JiYong:** Morning folks. I was already knee-deep in sawdust working on a coffee table. Mornings are best for carpentry - quiet and uninterrupted.

**Midday:**

**123524 Chloé:** Just finished an amazing dance collab at Seoul Dance Studio with Jesse and JiYong! Any new dance moves you want to show off, guys? 😉

**124018 Jesse:** Haha, Chloé, I think my moves are best kept in the studio. Thanks for the invite, today's session was so invigorating! 🕺✨

**124532 JiYong:** Agreed, Chloé. Was great combining our energies. We should make this a regular thing.

**125029 Andrew:** Wish I could’ve joined! Your dance sessions always sound so full of life. I was stuck at a café brainstorming my podcast with Neha. The coffee was good though ☕✨.

**130102 Haelim:** Your dance collab sounds fun! I had a lovely art walk at Gyeongbokgung Palace this morning, and lunch with JiHoon at Neungdong Forest was refreshing. We talked a lot about our creative projects 🌳🎨.

**130458 Chloé:** Sounds so peaceful, Haelim! 🌸 What kind of projects are you working on now?

**130954 Jesse:** Yes, do tell, Haelim! Always interested in your new ideas 😊.

**131312 JiHoon:** Hey all, the lunch with Haelim was fantastic. We discussed her upcoming art center for the elderly. It’s going to be such a beautiful space.

**131619 JiYong:** That's wonderful, Haelim. I love hearing about your initiatives. Maybe we can collaborate on an art-café event sometime?

**131835 Haelim:** I'd love that, JiYong! Let's make it happen. 

**131951 Andrew:** Y’all are so inspiring! Might integrate some storytelling elements into those events if you’d have me.

**Afternoon:**

**140236 Andrew:** Just had a brainstorming session with Neha. We’re thinking of infusing Korean folklore into my podcast. Got some brilliant ideas brewing 🔥.

**140955 Chloé:** That sounds amazing, Andrew! Can’t wait to listen to it. Korean folklore has such rich stories!

**141341 Jesse:** Absolutely. I’ve been sketching a lot lately inspired by folklore too. Art and stories blend so well.

**141712 Andrew:** So true, Jesse. We’re weaving stories from all our cultural backgrounds. It’s like a tapestry of tales.

**142006 JiHoon:** Andrew, I can’t wait to hear those. Might help with some mental health narratives too. Stories are such a powerful tool.

**142354 Haelim:** On that note, I just finished an art therapy session. So powerful to see how creativity brings joy and healing to the elderly 🌟.

**142753 JiYong:** 

That's amazing, Haelim. These small sessions make such a difference.

**143118 Jesse:** Really admire your work, Haelim. I had a similar experience at my community art space. Hoping to integrate more therapy sessions as well.
