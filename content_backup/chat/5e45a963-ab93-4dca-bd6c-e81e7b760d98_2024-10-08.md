102015 Luca: Wow, sounds like serenity rolled into poetry. Speaking of lyrics, back to the tactile fun—I met Ava, a textile diva, who made tea-dyed muslin sound like a symphony of creativity 🎶

103130 Leila: Textile diva? Sounds like my type of gig! Maybe I should sew our group collab outfits—cosmic fashion showcase?
