103501 Zoe: Morning, guys! 🌅 Just wrapped up an amazing tech-infused art session—such a crazy blend of magic and tech!
104512 Max: Hey! I just finished a pottery workshop. Made something that I *think* is an amp, or... just a weird bowl 😂🎵
105011 Hana: Morning, everyone! I started my day with a serene bike ride through Seoul Forest Park 🌳. It was such a peaceful escape.
